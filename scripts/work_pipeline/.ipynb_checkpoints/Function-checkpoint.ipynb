By using React hooks, Context and other open source projects you can easily build your own useful library. I wanted first class TypeScript support, immutable data, zero boilerplate and hassle free wiring. I built it in a few dozen lines of code: Immutable Context. I'll demo how to use it via a Code Sandbox demo, how it works under the hood and then look at some lessons learned, with suggestions on how to build your own state management library in 2019. ABOUT MEI'm a polyglot developer and data scientist. I've built lots of apps, for example this iPhone app for Isometric graphics. My website/blog is www.amimetic.co.uk. I work with React/React Native at JPMorgan. My Twitter handle is @complexview ------------------------------------------How and why use Machine Learning in NodeJS.Berkmann18 The talk would be focused on giving you the pointers and tools to solve problems where ML is usually the best solution as well as how you can hit the ground running. I’ll go over some general concepts in ML and then dive into how I leveraged limdu and created a multi-label classifier (called ac-learn) and how you can do the same. All while seeing how fun and amazing it can be. ABOUT MEI'm a Computer Science placement student working at BWC in Project Management, Web Dev and various other things (e.g. GDPR and IT support). I've been working with JS for about 7 years and with NodeJS for about 3 years and simply love almost everything about it.Twitter: @Berkmann18 ------------------------------------------ Interested in speaking?

      " DIZZY! MY HEAD IS SPINNING...LIKE A WHIRLPOOL IT NEVER ENDS! Some songs just BRING the PARTY and this is one of those songs. Originally recorded by Tommy Roe in 1969, the vibe of the original is WAAYY different to this 1991 hit. It was subsequently covered several times by acts such as Boney M, Wreckless Eric & Billy J Kramer. The 90s see the song bought to life once again. A wacky fusion of TV comedy star and über cool alternative rock band covering a 60s hit. Throw in a music video featuring Vic & the band flanked by rows of washing machines plus a cameo from a well known darts player - I ask you...what could possibly go wrong?! Apparently nothing as the song shot straight to No.1 in the UK Charts and stayed there for over 2 weeks... You know what this song needs? A CHOIR VERSION!! Now which choir would be mad enough to do that... :-) ALSO...We've got a \"SUMMER SUPER SO CHOIR!\" VIDEO SHOOT pencilled in the diary for SUN 28TH JULY and this song is on the bill! Keep a look out for the official meetup event for this coming very soon and get yourself RSVPd :-) So Choir! is the brilliant social singing meetup.Get together each week in a cool bar and learn to sing great pop and rock songs together in awesome harmony. Just turn up, meet up and sing! Doesn't matter if you've never sung before or feel you can't sing. There are no auditions, no sheet music, no stuffy rules and you'll never have to sing on your own - in fact, forget everything you've ever imagined a choir to be because So Choir! couldn't be more different. As always, £7 on the night, free hugs. LET THERE BE HARMONIES!! NB: PLEASE, PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH THE SONG - WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW! https://youtu.be/DOlG92rb2Zg\n",

      " The Bristol Business Brainstorm is a group for Entrepreneurs to help each other solve their business challenges. Each month, two or three businesses 'pitch' their current business challenge to the group, who then brainstorm solutions, ideas and advice to help resolve that challenge. Typically, 20+ ideas are generated per challenge, for the business owner to take away and develop further. Businesses and guests are from a variety of industries and specialisms, which helps generate a refreshing range of perspectives, valuable insight and inspiration.

      " ROCHESTER HISTORY WALKING TOURSWhether you’re coming for a once-in-a-lifetime visit, or you’re a local and would like to know more about the town you call home, an entertaining walking tour with one of our knowledgeable guides is a great way of getting a real flavour of one of Britain’s most historic towns! CASTLE AND CATHEDRAL PRECINCT TOURCovering everything from...the earliest origins of Rochester,the Roman occupation,the unique Norman Castle Keep – and what King John did to it!,the Cathedral and its’ hidden secret,the World famous actress who grew up in the shadow of the Cathedral (no, not Kelly Brook!),how ‘swift justice’ was dispensed in the Middle Ages,the 16th Century philanthropist whose legacy has provided homes for hundreds of Rochester pensionersand ...two of the most gruesome executions in the history of England! And you thought Rochester was BORING???? DURATION OF TOUR – 2-2.5 hours + refreshment break in one of the oldest pubs in Britain WHAT’S THE COST?All our guided walking tours are offered on a DONATION-ONLY basis. We believe NO ONE should be prevented from learning due to cost. In the case of Rochester, that can be up to £17 for a ticket to a guided walk. For some people, £1 is a lot of money. For that reason we leave the cost entirely to your discretion. WHERE TO FIND OUR GUIDE - Meet your guide by the ‘Welcome to Rochester Castle’ sign board, by the Boley Hill car park, opposite the rear of Ye Arrow public house. Your guide will be holding a yellow meeting board showing ‘RHWT TOUR GUIDE’ so you can recognise them. START TIME – Please read the listing CAREFULLY for start time. We vary start times to allow as many people as possible to join us. PLEASE NOTE - Children are welcome on all our tours, but parents should note that some of the content of the tour may not be suitable for the under 11’s as history can be a brutal thing, and there are very few places to sit along the routes, so children will be on their feet for the whole duration of the tour. For updates to your booking and telephone contact details for your guide, please email us at: [masked]\n",

The next book club sees us return to the sci-fi genre and an easy-to-read and popular book; one that has recently been adapted into a film: Ready Player One by Ernest Cline. \"The strength of Cline's first novel, other than its geeky referencing of 1980s pop culture, is the characterisation of the Candide-like Wade and his redemptive quest in both VR and the real world.\" (-The Guardian.) \"And like most of humanity, Wade is obsessed by the ultimate lottery ticket that lies concealed within this alternate reality: OASIS founder James Halliday, who dies with no heir, has promised that control of the OASIS - and his massive fortune - will go to the person who can solve the riddles he has left scattered throughout his creation.\" (-Online review.) Get the book from bookshops, online outlets or explore the online catalogues of local libraries. Venue: Kahve Dunyasi, 200 Piccadilly, London W1J 9HU. 2pm start. Book Club Rules:*Reading the book is required, even if you read a single chapter.*Discussion is centred around the book and its theme. [The book club is looking for future hosts, even as a one-off.

If you have any side projects that you need help with or want to show off, then bring them along and we'll give you any help you need.

      " Chris Mackey has long been interested in positive psychology, a science of wellbeing which, like other areas of psychology such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, is gradually showing more interest in spirituality. About 25 to 30% of Westerners consider themselves 'spiritual but not religious' and clairvoyants, tarot card readers and other alternative practitioners are these days consulted more often than mainstream mental health professionals, showing the general public’s interest in a transpersonal dimension in life. Chris's latest book The Positive Psychology of Synchronicity explores uncannily meaningful coincidences, which can be of particular interest to many people who are interested in enhancing their wellbeing, and are interested in a spiritual or soul dimension in life. Synchronicity can be a helpful pointer to an optimal life path, as it tends to happen more often when we sense that we are on the right track. Hear Chris talk about the book, its relation to 20th century Jungian frameworks and the importance of synchronicity in our spiritual lives today at this free talk at the Watkins esoteric bookshop in the heart of London's Cecil Court. After the talk you can even ask Chris your questions, meet the author and get your book signed!\n",

Have a chat with some of the other South West Test(ers), Grab some food and have a few drinks. :) 18:30 - Quick Intro 18:35 - Talk One \"Our journey of choosing the right UI automation tool\" - By Gianni Au and Kalyan Kamkipati As our UI for the systems we have developed has moved from a more MVC based framework to a more angular based framework, we wanted to choose an appropriate tool for our UI automation suite. The talk will take you through a journey of how we went about doing this. We'll be talking about the different criteria that we used, through to the tests that we wrote to arrive at our conclusion. We'll be focussing on cypress, puppeteer, protractor and testcafe. 19:00 - Short Break 19:05 - Talk Two Ciara Gardiner and Frances Bromley will present their exploration into the use of cloud, continuous integration and performance tools and technologies. They will focus on how the use of these tools has helped them, to explore the performance of the DataHelix, which is a Scott Logic developed, data generation tool. Ciara is a graduate tester at Scott Logic, following a degree in computer science where she first began exploring verification and validation techniques. Ciara is currently mid-way through grad training at Scott Logic and is naturally using this time to explore as many technologies and techniques as possible! She is currently working in Cypress, Postman and getting involved in some Exploratory testing exercises. Frances is currently working as a Test Engineer and will soon complete her first year at Scott Logic, having started as a graduate last year.

I will talk you through the massive impact that putting empathy first can have and then my top tips on how you can learn to bring it to the forefront of your mind, with an opportunity to practice. Christina Daly - How to get the best from teams Teams are like tribes all of their own. Each one has a unique set of strengths and dysfunctions that shape the way they work.

      "####\n",
      " The whole area of mental ill health is officially termed 'abnormal psychology'. Yet among the hundreds of labels there is a glaring omission: there is no agreement in psychology on what constitutes 'normality' or 'sanity'. Societies generally see normality in terms of a person's behaviour, i.e. the more socially acceptable their behaviour the more 'normal' they are. The big problem with this is that what is socially acceptable not only varies hugely across cultures but also from age to age. So does 'normal' even exist? And if it doesn't, how can psychology claim to know what 'abnormal' is? Here is a piece I wrote on this a while ago. Just scroll down to 'Abnormal (or not)?' http://www.adrianblake.co.uk/blog/ Do feel free to post comments. If posting links to articles bear in mind the psychology group embraces everyone, not just those with an academic or psychology background. So links to non-academic material are equally valued.\n",

      " Come & join us on a hike to Corfe Castle – one of England's most majestic ruins! The first stone of Corfe Castle was laid more than 1,000 years ago and since then it has been at the centre of battles, plots and mysteries. It has been a treasury, military garrison, royal residence and family home. On this day hike, we will discover this iconic medieval skyscraper standing 21 meter tall, on the top of a 55-meter-high hill. Corfe Castle dominates the skyline of the Purbecks for miles around and the views are simply breathtaking. Our route will follow the Purbeck Way, taking in England’s first natural UNESCO World Heritage Site – the Jurassic Coast. Throughout the walk, we will enjoy awe-inspiring panoramic views of the Purbeck Hills and the Dorset coast. HIKE HIGHLIGHTS: • Golden, sandy beaches of Studland Bay and Knoll Beach – one of the most prominent nudist beaches in the UK.• Stunning panoramic views of the Jurassic Coast and one of the most famous landmarks on the South Coast – Old Harry Rocks. According to legend, the 65 million-year-old chalk outcroppings were named Old Harry as a euphemism for the devil, who allegedly used to nap on the rocks. Another story tells of the pirate and smuggler Harry Paye who attacked many merchant ships as they left Poole Harbour, storing his spoils nearby.• Wonderful panoramic views of the seaside towns of Poole and Swanage.• Ruins of a thousand-year-old Corfe Castle. DISTANCE & DIFFICULTY: Distance: 11 miles (18 km).Ascent: 200 metres. Difficulty: Moderate (http://www.nwhiker.com/HikeEval.html). This hike is suited for people with a medium level of fitness. ITINERARY: 07:45 meet near Hotel Novotel London West, 1 Shortlands, W6 8DR (five minute walk from Hammersmith Station); 08:00 sharp departure; 11:00-15:30 hiking to Corfe Castle; 15:30-17:00 lunch/dinner in the picturesque village of Corfe Castle; 17:00 departure; 20:00 London, Hammersmith.

Through my experience of founding and running three digital businesses over eight years, I have discovered that a critical element relating to the growth and success of the companies has been working with smart creatives. Teams thrive when these questioning and focused generalists catch the vision and run with it. I share my experience of switching your thinking to become more ‘smart creative’ and explore how to spot and then grow smart creatives to their full potential. --- Pete has been working in digital for just over eight years, continuing to build on his interest in web development, kindled in his early teens. When not at his desk, you can often find Pete running, playing football or planning his next adventure. Managing Director at Steadfast Collective, his key focus is on building a team of smart creatives to build industry-changing web applications. Pete also founded and runs SAAS application Tap; the easiest WordPress hosting you will ever use. ---- Are you interested in talking at our next meetup?

      " Beverley Gene Coraldean, aka Genealityart, likes to illustrate all things complicated and is known for drawing amazingly detailed landscapes, architectural style illustration and decorative lettering. You'll have seen her work around Norwich, including at the Norfolk and Norwich Festival, the mural on Rampant Horse Street and in the Norwich Lanes colouring book. ---------------------------------https://twitter.com/genealityarthttps://www.genealityart.com/--------------------------------- Join us for an informal intro to hand drawn lettering, with Beverley Gene Coraldean Hand drawn lettering is pretty accessible these days. It draws on knowledge we already have and the tools are readily available. What is more, the beauty of hand lettering is that everyone’s style is unique and imperfection is key. Join in with this drop-in workshop to have a go at brush lettering that can be used for everything from design and illustration to making your own stationery. Try out making your own quick brush script logo and learn some tips and tricks to improve on your designs. Materials will be provided but feel free to bring a sketchbook, any special pens you might want to try or an Ipad/Ipencil/Procreate if you wish! Structure: • Slideshow and Introductions: 20 minutes • Practicing brush script lettering: 20 minutes. I’ll explaining that absolutely anyone can create brush lettering using something they already know (how to write!) and that the beauty of hand lettering is in the imperfections. We will then have a go at some individual letters to get the hang of some of the ‘rules’ before breaking them to create our own unique style. • Re-imagining your business name and logo: 30 minutes. Using the ‘rules’ that we’ve looked at, (left on the screen/projector) and brush pens/ layout paper we will have a go at drawing as many different versions of our company name (or just your own name if you prefer!) as quickly as possible. • Tips and tricks to make your piece of type stronger: 30 minutes. Then we will look at things we can do to improve on our logos. We will examine processes to make them more legible and try adding lines, loops and squiggles. Hopefully everyone will leave with a piece of type that they are pleased with and knowledge of how to continue on their brush script practice, should they wish to! We'll be holding this meetup upstairs at the Dog House, St. George's Street, Norwich\n",

      " Introduction Hello there! - We'd like to welcome you to Free meetings hosted by Preeti & Peter which take place at: 45 Church Hill Road, Solihull, B91 3JA Please contact us to book your places beforhand as dates & times may vary & or the meeting may not be running every week: -  Please call (Preeti) on:[masked] or via  email: <a>[masked]</a> All across the globe, many are seeking new sources of energy. Meanwhile, the most transformative energy of all is hiding in plain sight, within us. It's natural, sustainable, and infinitely renewable. It's called inner kundalini energy. And everyone already has it — everyone!. It is often likened to an inner feminine or motherly energy which automatically knows about us and what is needed to help us restore balance and harmony within our subtle being. It works spontaneously, effortlessly, organically and cannot be paid for. Sahaja Yoga Meditation is a simple time-honoured technique that lets you tap into that energy and harness its power to become better balanced and better connected to yourself — emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritually. If you're having trouble juggling the challenges in your life, Sahaja Yoga Meditation might well help you manage stress, master your emotions and find solutions to your problems. You may enjoy better health, better focus, and a deeper understanding of the universe and your place in it. Meditation is not just for mystics and monks. Sahaja Yoga meditation is for everyone. Anyone can do it. It's that easy. But with the Sahaja Yoga experience, you'll quickly realise, it isn't your typical Meditations 'R Us type class. It's much more than just feeling peaceful and relaxed. Sahaja Yoga Meditation has many layers, varied and deep. Explore at your own pace, in your own way. Our volunteer experts are always available to help. Ready to plug into your inner energy? A Sahaja Yoga Meditation class is a great way to start. A few minutes of your life may be all it takes to connect to your inner energy and light the path to lifelong transformation. Sahaja Yoga is more than a temporary solution or quick relief — it is a journey, rather than a destination. It's all about energy — guaranteed pure and carbon neutral. You can never have too much of it. The best part? All classes are free. No strings, no catch.Everyone is welcome. Bring a friend, bring your self — all are welcome. If you every happen to be in London have a web site there which you can visit for more info about weekly meetings: www.sahajayogalondon.co.uk </a> Join us on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/London.Free.Meditation\">Facebook and Twitter\n",

      " AI Naughts and Crosses Competition! The future of sport could be dominated by AI and Programmers will be the stars! Maybe… Everyone can get started with Machine Learning and fun competitions are a great way to learn about the different algorithms you can use to train a neural network. This next workshop will be hosted by Thomas Ankcorn and Hew Ingram, who have built a Bot vs Bot tournament simulator that lets you create and test out your AI and see how well it does against a rule-based bot. Bring a laptop because this is a chance to get started with machine learning, or show everyone your ML skills! In this workshop we will show you how we created a bot to play Tic-tac-toe using BrainJS, talk about the decisions made when creating it, and possible optimisations that could be made. Then, using this code as a starting point you will use your creativity to enter the first AI JavaScript London tournament. At the end of the Meetup we will run the simulator that will pitch all the AIs against each other to find a winner. Hew Ingram@hewingramHew is a Full Stack engineer at Applied (a little startup striving to make hiring fairer, smarter and easier - driving forward diversity in companies). He predominantly use JS but dabbles with bits of Python, PHP and making cheese. Lover of all things Javascript, and a big fan of building cool (weird) things, often for the hell of it. Thomas Ankcorn@thomasankcornThomas is a software engineer at Near.st building a real-time local inventory data platform to help small businesses fight back against the growth of online shopping. Outside of work, he's chasing his life long dream of having a dog.

      " *PLEASE NOTE THE CHANGE OF VENUE!* We’re doing things a bit differently this week - we’re going to get out and about today on a Story Safari. Why? To put a dose of curiosity into our day, and boost our creativity. Stories surround us - but we’re busy. We often are in a hurry to get from A to B, or we get engrossed in our phones. We don’t always stop to notice what’s going on around us. So today we’re going to slow down and observe. You’ll be tasked with looking out for a number of things. You can go alone, in pairs or a group - as long as you take time to notice! We’ll spend about 30 minutes out and about, and then reconvene to share our findings. Meeting point is the Library Gardens in Leigh, directly behind the library. Please meet promptly at 9 am. We’ll have a run through of what to do and then we’ll head off in our different directions. You can use your Story Safari time to get a coffee so no need to worry about getting one beforehand! We’ll meet back at the Library Gardens at 9.45/10.00 to discuss what we discovered. We may sit on the ground - so you might like to bring something to sit on. Also, bring your phone to snap a photo, and a notebook and pen to jot things down. Keep an eye out on your emails/on here for changes of plan if it’s forecast to rain. It's free - but I'd love to raise money for Anti-Slavery International and I suggest a voluntary donation of whatever you fancy (in addition please to the usual donation of £1 towards the maintenance of this group) If you’re not local to Leigh, good independent coffee shops include Barlow and Fields down the alley beside Ugo's and Corner Club on the main Broadway as you head east.\n",

      " What an elusive thing happiness is - we all want it yet most of us have no idea how to attain it! With maturity, we realise it doesn't come from wealth, power, fame, possessions or other people - so what can we do to experience the only thing we really desire as worldly things lose their shine, as they always do, sooner or later? A Course in Miracles has some wonderful teachings to reveal the way to happiness and Lia takes us on an inspiring journey today to discover how we can live our lives in peace, love and joy - in other words, to be happy. About Lia Steinson: A dedicated Life Counsellor and Course Teacher of many years' standing, Lia is focused upon awakening us to the experience of our sense of purpose, unconditional love and true connection rather than just theoretical knowledge.

      " Back by very popular demand, following our first event of this kind in February... once again it's ALL about YOU!! The feedback we have had from our community is great...and the ONE THING you all want to know more about...is EACH OTHER. So….lets make it happen. We come for the content and stay for the connection. Well this time, come for the connection and we will also wow you with some great content. This month, rather than a dedicated speaker, Daniel and Kristina, founders of Entrepreneurs For Good and CATORI will bring TEDx style wisdom combined with age old community sharing and discussions. Everybody has a vision, but sharing it can be scary. The reality is that the first step can be the most challenging, but every great journey began with a single step. Our community holds many things, one of them is a safe space to share the most daring of ideas. Everything is a vibration/frequency in this world, from the colour red to solid objects like chairs...well, IDEAS are no different. So come along with whatever you have, a thought, an idea, a monologue, a picture or maybe a perfect sentence. Share with us, to cultivate your idea so that we can hold that frequency to be as strong in us as it is in you. It’s only through clear articulation of your vision that others can not only understand what you want, but then be able to help you achieve it through contribution. We look forward to creating magic together --------------------------------------------------------------- WHAT ARE YOU COMING TO? Manchester is proud to host Entrepreneur City Social.

      " Hello everyone! Hope you're all doing well and enjoying the glorious British summer. We are back in a few weeks this time at the prestigious BBC Broadcasting House with 3 great talks by 3 amazing speakers... Talk 1: Plotting: The Joy of Analogue by James Carruthers A talk about the joys and pitfalls of putting pen to paper by way of computer controlled hardware. From making old technology talk to a modern machine, to writing efficient code and choosing pens and paper. James is an inter-disciplinary designer, with interests in electronic and mechanical engineering, synthesisers and cats. Talk 2: The Non-Human Dances: An exploration into Computational performers by Amy Cartwright When we see a dance performance, more often than not, we expect to see a dancing body. Probably a human dancing body. What if we were to challenge this by asking: To what extent can a non-human body be introduced into a live performance and still be considered a dancer? ‘The Non-Human Dances’ is an ongoing research project that is comprised of a series of live performances that each feature, non-human dancers. The aim of this series is to examine the possibilities around working with a more fluid perception of the dancing body in live performance. Amy Cartwright is a London based dance performer, choreographer and creative coder. Creating computational choreographies that use technology within live performance. Amy is interested in questioning the inherent humanity involved in dance performance and re- searching how computational processes, particularly artificial intelligence, can be used with live dance performance. Exploring possibilities around wearable technologies, non-human performers and computational choreography. Amy is a recipient of the inaugural V&A Digital programmes and Goldsmiths Computing ‘Computational Arts Residency’. This opportunity has allowed her to work on furthering her research creating a new piece which concentrates on the agency of the non-human dancer in live performance. Not limited to live performance Amy’s work spans across many mediums, including; interactive pieces, instillation works and digital art. Talk 3: Drawing with Code - an Architectural wandering by Jessica In Jessica will talk about the ideas and inspirations behind her approach to design as informed by a her background as an architect + creative coder. She’ll discuss how time based approaches to drawing can inform architectural explorations and will share some of her recent projects. Jessica is an architect, designer, creative coder + educator. She currently freelances independently and in collaboration across architecture, design + installation projects while teaching at the Bartlett School of Architecture. She has a particular interest in physically embodied interactions that explore semantic and relational conditions between immaterial + virtual space. Her current work is specifically focused on drawing, machine learning and robotics, however she can also be found coding visuals for identity and performance, creating virtual environments for string marionettes as well as making industrial robots dance with light. As always, we'll head to a local pub afterwards (TBC). As we know this is going to be popular. Tickets are limited and will be available from 11am this Thursday (4th July). Please only RSVP if you are certain you will attend. -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Finally, thank you to the BBC for hosting and sponsoring us... The BBC creates the best “listen” and”watch” experiences for millions of users. BBC iPlayer & BBC Sounds are two of the BBC flagship products and our world class tech team is always growing.

      " ⚠️Details:July Health Optimisation Biohacker London Meetup. Theme of the month:Biohacks for Backs: How optimising your posture improves health & mental clarity. We'll also have some awesome brands coming along too - including the guys from Vivo Barefoot, Nuzest Clean Lean Protein, and Tim Cook's Biohacking Super-Snoothies. Speaker: ⭐️Natalie Robertson ⭐️ Director of Spirohealth: Advanced Biostructural Correction (ABC). Description:As many of you may know, Marek Doyle recommended me to try working on my posture with an \"ABC Style\" Chiropractor, and said it would help my sciatica, digestion issues, bladder problems, and mental clarity. It did. It also helped the headaches that I couldn't shift by rehydrating. FYI it's so much more than just chiropractic work. Last week I put a poll in our Facebook Group to see if this was a topic everyone wanted, and it was the biggest vote we've ever had. So I'm very pleased to make this happen. 3 Key Learnings/Takeaways from Natalies talk: 👉🏻How structure and posture = function, and if your structure isn't right you may not be utilising supplements properly, and might not getting the results you want. 👉🏻How to have your body stay upright with no muscular effort – everyone else says it is impossible but it will happen with your body before the end of the evening. 👉🏻The 1 thing you can do in 2 minutes to impact your hormone levels for the better, mainly testosterone and cortisol. 👉🏻How ABC can get your body not just feeling better but getting WELL and optimising your function. Something to think about:Roger Sperry PhD 1981- 90% of the energy output of the brain is used relating physical body to the gravitational field. The more distorted you are - the less energy you have for healing, inspired thought and metabolism. Fix your posture properly, and many health issues resolve quickly. ⛔️PLUS:👉🏻2 cool brands sampling their goodies!👉🏻A get together to catch up and mingle, and make friends. Just awesome Biohacking/Bulletproof/Ketogenic/Paleo/Health Optimisation friends to hang with and discuss what we've learnt in the last 6 weeks👉🏻Get Free Bulletproof Coffee on tap (as always!).👉🏻Try TimCook.co Plant Based Biohacking Smoothies👉🏻Try red light therapy (if you haven't already!) from Red Light Rising Attendee limit:We have grown so much, we're now the biggest group of frequently meeting Biohackers ON THE PLANET. We now consistently get over 120 health optimisers each month, and as a result we're now having to put a limit on how many people come along, so please confirm that you're coming, and register as soon as you can (or you wont get in). Where?We're meeting in our regular home, courtesy of our good friends at BrainLabs Digital. Building 4, 2 Old Street Yard, (exit 3 from Old Street station), London EC1Y 2BP It's 30 metres from exit 3 Old Street Tube (right behind Passo restaurant) - someone will be in reception to see you upstairs.

The group is for women aged 30 and over who are interested in living a fulfilling life, meeting new friends, and a little time to do something nice for themselves. Roughly half the evening is for pure socialising and the other half is an easy and enjoyable workshop/activity led by myself, Sophie Thomas. As a women’s Life & Wellbeing Coach ( www.sophiethomaslife.coach ) you’ll get my expertise and encouragement. In the monthly meet-ups we’ll cover all sorts of inspiring and nourishing areas that explore the important balance of knowing what we want and how to reach it whilst celebrating and being at peace with where and who we are now. Topics may include cultivating clarity, confidence, purpose, health, vitality, positive thinking, the feminine essence, success, self-care, self-esteem and relaxation and meditation tools. Life is busy...this is our time to feel-good and fill our cups back up! The main criteria is that you’re kind - it’s important that it’s a safe and uplifting space where we all feel supported. We meet the second Tuesday of every month just outside of Farnham (the address is shared when you become a group member and register for an event). The cost contributes towards the meetup.com fee which I pay, a selection of delicious teas and healthy snacks (gluten, vegan and sugar free catered for). I look forward to welcoming you.Sophie x\n",

You’ll meet people who have done it and they will tell you how to position yourself towards an architecture based role. Dev to Architecture.. And How? Hosted by ENSEK. The inaugural Harvey Nash: Technology & Knowledge Sharing Meetup will be discussing how you transition from dev to architecture. The idea behind this event is for everyone to share their journey, their knowledge and aid someone else in their career. Our guest speaker will be Chris Fenton, currently Enterprise Architect for Browne Jacobson who in his career has come from development through to architecture. He will be sharing his experience on how he did it, what helped him and what may help you in your transition. Kick off at 18:30, welcome drinks and networking from 18:00. After the planned talk we will continue networking giving everyone an opportunity to share their own experiences before heading to Canalhouse for a drink where everyone is welcome. Whilst facilitated by a guest speaker to kick things off we want the discussion to be led by delegates, creating an environment to share thoughts, war stories and your own experiences. This is an invite only event with limited spaces and all attendees will be vetted before receiving a formal invite from Matt & Will. Refreshments will be provided; pizza, beer, soft drinks, tea/coffee. We look forward to seeing you there.\n",

      " I am just putting this out there to see what the interest is, looking to book a large house that can accommodate 10 people, there are a few with 5 bedrooms so obviously this would mean sharing, sure with some imagination space could be found. Cost looks to be around[masked] for 7 nights Sunday to Sunday, so between 150 to 200 per person, plus food, I was thinking of booking this from the Sunday between Xmas and New year for 7 nights, if you want to come down for less that would be OK but would still have to pay the equal split, obviously will find somewhere and book only if I can generate enough interest, Cornwall is a great place to spend new year as so many people go there and the atmosphere is electric with whole villages going fancy dress 😂😂😂\n",

      " Hi ladies, Welcome to the Travel Queen Scotland Meet Up Group and our first meet up event! 🎉 We have over 100 members and growing since launching a few weeks ago and I know you're all keen to meet and find out more about the trips that will be available through the group. I run group tours for women through my company Travel Queen and I'm currently running trips for women in their 20s to 50s to Croatia and Thailand (more destinations and trips coming in the future!)...4 members of this group from Scotland have already booked onto tours to Thailand in November and January! 😊 At this event I'll explain why I set up Travel Queen from my own personal travel experiences and discovering a big gap in the market for women looking for the friendship, safety and fun of travelling in a group of likeminded women, who don't want to rough it on a shoestring with 18 year old backpackers and are too young for Saga type trips for retirees! I'll then run through a 'virtual tour' of both the Croatia and Thailand trips and the fantastic accommodation and activities that are all included, and you can meet other women interested in going. I have a number of Thailand Adventure tours planned in Jan, Feb, March & November 2020 and will soon be launching new Croatia Adventure tours in June and September 2020. Coming along to this relaxed, friendly event is a great way to find out more and meet other women from Scotland keen to travel... who might just be your new travel buddies on a future tour! Plus you can meet me as I personally look after each group on the tours to take care of everything 😊. You can see loads of updates, feedback and reviews from women who have joined our recent tours on our Travel Queen Facebook page here: https://www.facebook.com/TravelQueenLTD/ Lots more information can be found at www.travel-queen.co.uk. The event will start at 11am and there'll be a welcome glass of prosecco, tea or coffee then I'll run through the tours and there'll be chance to get some brunch and more drinks to get to know each other better and ask any questions about the trips. Tigerlily is a gorgeous bar and restaurant (see images below) on George Street in Edinburgh city centre, close to the Royal Mile, home to Edinburgh Castle, and Princess Street shopping. If you fancy making a day out of it after the event then the Edinburgh Fringe Festival will also be on this weekend. I look forward to meeting you in Edinburgh soon! 😊 Mel\n",

The area is also known as a habitat for red kites - look up to see them hovering overhead. This walk starts by heading across the meadows from Marlow before crossing the Thames at Temple lock and then onto the ancient village of Hurley; little changed since the days when it was a Benedictine Abbey. The walk then returns to Marlow following the Thames path all the way back. 7.5 miles: approx 3.5 hours. In order to make the most of the outdoors, please bring lunch or snacks and water. Please read this page for a description of the walking levels.

Natalie & Jason from Zurich Insurance will talk you through what to test and when, with what tools, and how to translate both qualitative & quantitative data into user friendly digital solutions that you can get the business on board with. Bio:Jason Bennett is Analytics Manager at Zurich. He has lots of experience working for largescale companies including Aviva and RAC before he joined the Zurich team. Natalie Burns is User Experience Manager at Zurich and has worked in UX both agency and client side for companies ranging from large housing developers to small charities before settling in at Zurich. They both work in Swindon and live in Bristol – which makes for many long debates about geeky web stuff down the M4, usually while listening to Kisstory. Refreshments will be provided :)\n",

KIND enables engineers to spin up local development cluster in under a minute, utilising Docker containers as \"nodes\". KIND was originally born as a method of running conformance tests for the Kubernetes project itself and has quickly gained in popularity within the community thanks to its fast start-up time, ease of use, and growing feature set. In this talk I will briefly look at how KIND differs from other local cluster tools, discuss a range of possible use-cases for KIND - both for local development and within CI/CD pipelines, and finally demonstrate how you can get starting using KIND. Ana-Maria Calin, Paybase - Demystifying Containerd and other container runtimes In 2016 Docker span out its core container runtime functionality into a standalone component, Containerd. Using Containerd developers can customize, extend and swap out functionality as needed, without unnecessary abstraction getting in their wayThis talk covers lessons learned by migrating a Kubernetes platform from a Docker Runtime based OS to a Containerd based OS. It includes observations around security, performance and usability, as well as the benefit of debugging using Crictl - Containerd’s cli, compared to the Docker cli. Find out if there’s a real benefit in swapping and the kind of effort required to achieve complete migration. Prasenjit Sarkar, Oracle - Multi-Stage Docker Build for effective Containers – Why & How Since the release of 17.05, Docker has introduced Multi-Stage Build for Docker Images for anyone who has struggled to optimize Dockerfiles while keeping them easy to read and maintain. This builder pattern will help anyone who would just like to have the runtime, configuration & application and doesn’t want to have compilers, debuggers, code, build, test logs etc. Sponsors:Tecknuovo - www.tecknuovo.com – Born out of the London tech scene, Tecknuovo bring together the brightest engineering minds, change agents and evangelists to challenge the traditional consultancy world.

Debate is a dispassionate attempt to get at the truth of any given issue through reason. An argument is two or more propositions leading to a conclusion that is meant to persuade someone of the truth of any given matter. Persuasion trumps coercion every time.

      " August Bank Holiday. The Scramblers' National 3 Peaks In 3 Days Deposit £125 on RSVP This one is for the fit hillwalkers amongst you who fancy a high-intensity challenge with a head for heights! We'll be taking a completely different approach to the UK's three highest peaks of Ben Nevis, Scafell Pike and Snowdon. Instead of the traditional 24-hour race against the clock, we'll be going at a slower pace over 3 days but with a twist as we'll be scrambling up these iconic mountains. Ben Nevis by the Carn Mor Dearg Arete is the finest way to climb the UK's highest mountain. This is a truly spectacular route incorporating 2 Munros and will live long in the memory. Scafell Pike is iconic, not only because it is the highest in England, but also because of its history, position and astonishing views. Alfred Wainwright described it as \"the Mecca of all weary pilgrims in Lakeland......the ultimate, the supreme, the top of Scafell Pike\". We'll hike to the summit of Scafell Pike via the lesser known Corridor route thus avoiding the crowds on the Wasdale side. And finally to Snowdon, or Yr Wyddfa, where there are a few scrambling options but the standout winner is the knife-edge ridge of Crib Goch from Pen y Pass. These routes are MUCH tougher than the regular routes and you will need to be fit hillwalkers to complete the challenge. Our client to guide ratio for scrambling is a maximum of 4 clients per 1 guide and we will only be able to accommodate 7 clients on this exclusive challenge. You will be accompanied by 2 experienced and friendly mountain leaders, Gareth Clarke and Pete Hyde, who will do everything to help you succeed. Accommodation: We have booked 3 nights' hostel accommodation in Fort William, the beautiful Borrowdale valley in the Lake District and Pen y Pass at the foot of Snowdon. The hostels are well-equipped with a lounge, restaurant/dining room, drying room, self-catering kitchen and a licensed bar. Meals: We will provide provisions for a simple breakfast and provisions for packed lunches for you to make up yourselves. For evening meals we will stop for food en route to the next night's accommodation. Cost: Total cost of trip is £425£125 deposit payable on RSVP, £300 balance payable by 23rd June to GO Venture LTD, account No[masked] sort code[masked] Please use reference N3P19 and message me to confirm receipt of balance. Your money is protected under the travel and package regulations. Full itinerary: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12N9mxk5dXD7qoCUtCx9gwxkoIo2XMH0qEwOpgzp7IMo/edit Included:- 3 days' guided hikes- 3 nights' hostel accommodation- Breakfast & lunch for 3 days- Celebratory meal in Llanberis before final departure- Pick up & drop-off at Coventry railway station- Transport throughout in a 9-seater minibus Not Included:- Transport to / from Coventry railway station- Evening meals- Extra snacks Kit List: Click here https://www.meetup.com/GO-London/pages/28584586/Scramblers%27_National_3_Peaks_kit_list Transport options: We'll pick you up from Coventry railway station at 10am and drive to Fort William.

      " The third in a twice-monthly series of programming lessons starting from scratch. All welcome to attend, from complete beginners up (the more experienced can help teach!). This will be very informal, I'll be plugged into a large screen to demo some stuff and we'll sit around a big table and code-along. Goals for this event, for those that have been to 1-2 sessions already: - Create a basic quiz web app using PHP, HTML and a MySQL database Goals for this session, for those that are brand-new or not completely set up yet: - Create your programming environment- Set up an Amazon EC2 instance- Make sure you can securely connect to it from your laptop- Install a web server and database (Apache and MySQL)- First steps in programming PHP- Create a hello world program You can get a head start by reading the 'Getting Started' page on the wiki:https://coding.openguide.co.uk/wiki/ We'll set aside some time for general Questions and Answers.If you have any technical questions before coming along, you can reach us on the Fediverse at https://glasgow.social/tags/coding or via #coding on irc.glasgow.social (read about IRC at https://irc.armchairscientist.co.uk). Once you've mastered these skills you should be ready to start making basic web apps (quizes, todo list etc). From there, the only limit is your imagination. Next meetups will cover more advance topics like user logins, session management, frameworks and more. But we'll try to keep these beginner level events happening around once a month. Also happy to work/teach in Python and demo some real-world apps and tools depending on demand. Note:- There is free tea and coffee at the event, but the Avalon give us this space for free, so ideally if you buy a coke or a beer that'd help keep them happy.- Bringing a laptop will help you get a lot more out of this event.\n",

      " Andrew (Drew) does not often read his poems in public. I was lucky enough to hear Andrew reading his poems a few years ago and was determent to host an evening of his beautiful work. Drew has been writing poetry for the last ten years — often on the local beach — and the poems have now evolved into a very powerful healing tool. They are channelled from the divine Angelic sources and cover many subjects, but their healing properties lie deep within the carefully chosen words and the way those words are constructed. The poems have been published many times in magazines and books, but they are also written to meet the personal requirements of clients. Because they come from a divine source the contents are accurate, emotionally uplifting and graciously moving. Andrew's work can be seen on his Facebook Page frequently, which gives much healing to his more than 3.000 followers. An evening not to be missed.\n",

      " Having been to Slovenia 1 seven times, due to demand we have decided to go there again.Click this link to see the reviews & photos (http://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/events/63919772/)from our previous trips. here are some photos on our Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/pg/AAALondonGroup/photos/?tab=album&album_id=743195265880767)September[masked] Slovenia & Julian Alps (http://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/events/221055622/)September[masked] Slovenia & Julian Alps (http://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/events/226724934/)Sept.2-7 Slovenia 1 in 2017: Julian Alps; Soca Emerald Trail (https://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/events/234174135/)Sept.15-20 Slovenia 1 in 2018: Julian Alps; Soca Emerald Trailhttps://www.meetup.com/AAA-London-Group/events/245004939/ Slovenia is a tiny country, about half the size of Switzerland (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=360810), and counts just over two million people. But the only way to describe pint-sized Slovenia (Slovenija), an independent republic bordering Italy (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=359845), Austria (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=358584), Hungary (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=359519), Croatia (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=358781) and the Adriatic Sea, is that it's 'a mouse that roars'. If you sign up for both Slovenia Trips: 1 and 2, you will have one night B&B hotel accommodation for free + transport in between for free! Most of the photos below were taken during our past trips in Slovenia. Slovenia has been dubbed a lot of things since independence in 1991 - 'Europe (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=358537) in Miniature', 'The Sunny Side of the Alps', 'The Green Piece of Europe (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=358537)' - and, though they may sound like tourist-brochure blurbs, they're all true. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9vUyVyQyok Nestled between Austria and Italy, Slovenia is a superb hiking destination, from the ridgetop trails that cross the snow-capped Julian Alps (http://www.slovenia.info/en/Tourist-destinations/Julian-Alps.htm?destinacije=135&lng=2) to the outrageously picturesque Logarska Dolina, a stunning glacier-carved valley flanked by the sheer peaks of the Kamnik-Savinja Alps.(http://www.inntravel.co.uk/Destinations/Slovenia) is all about immersing yourself in a scenery of incredible natural beauty.  There are many different routes in Bovec area, most of them have been hiked by the group in previous years, some of them starting in Italy and hiking back to Slovenia but there are still more trails to discover. You may go scrambling with the challenging team and experienced leader.You may also follow the pleasant and fairly easy Trenta/Soca Emerald trail and check out pure water of Soca river.  Here is a video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BlOIC07t29Q) nicely presenting this amazing country. The Triglav National Park (http://www.tnp.si/national_park/), the only national park in Slovenia, lies in the immediate vicinity of Bled. It comprises one of the most beautiful and attractive areas of Slovenia, almost the entire Slovenian part of the Julian Alps. The territory of the National Park is very picturesque and varied. The highest mountain in Slovenia, Triglav (2864 m), after which the park was named, lies in its centre. From Triglav, deep and sharply cut valleys, mainly of glacial origin, open on all sides in the form of a fan.During this trip, we will be based in Bovec town in the Soca river valley. Bovec is very close to the Italian border, this is why some of the hikes may start in Italy. We plan to finish the trip with lunch in the Italian mountain hut. The region of the Soča Valley (Posočje) stretches from Triglav National Park to Nova Gorica (http://www.lonelyplanet.com/destinationRedirector?atlasId=360723). Its most dominant feature is the 136km Soča River, which can widen to 500m and narrow to less than a metre but always stays a deep, almost unreal aquamarine colour. The valley has more than its share of historical sights, but most people come here for rafting, hiking and skiing. Deeply carved into the white limestone of the magnificent Julian Alps is the Soča Valley. It is a valley of wonderful colours, full of waterfalls, pools, ravines and canyons, with its own distinct flora and fauna. The impossibly blue-green River Soča flows over white gravel and through this fairy-tale valley. The Emerald Trail (http://www.hotelclub.com/blog/emerald-route-slovenia/) follows the river in the most amazing places.WATER ACTIVITIES The town of Bovec offers world-class adventure sports, great for the adrenaline junkie. We may arrange this on our arrival. Last year we had great time rafting down the river Soča, which is known to be among the most beautiful rivers in Europe.We plan to visit and hike in all the above places, the trip will also involve some optional activities: Rafting, Canyoning, Kayaking, Zipwiring and many more. We can not tell you a day to day agenda at this stage because it always depends on the weather conditions. HIKING There will be at least 2-3 experienced hike leaders on this trip plus we have a local guide - Nejc who has been guiding our group for the last 7 years if we need we may split a group into 2-3 smaller groups so members can choose a hike according to their fitness and abilities!But we can tell you one thing, you will remember this holiday forever.

      " \"The Power of Relational Thinking in a Tech Context\" This talk reflects on the amazing web of complex relationships that exist in the tech and delivery world where we all have a responsibility to look after each other. We will look at what those relationships are and be practical about it. Come ready to share your experiences and to be challenged. ‘I work with you, you work with me, we work with each other. Or do we?’ The tech world brings exciting challenges to us all but sometimes we barely have time to learn something new before another trend, tool or language appears. But at the core of it all people are still there. ‘We’ is you and me; it is the client and us; it is the QA and the scrum master; it is the PMO and the delivery team. We all interact and the ways in which we do will be explored here . WHO Sebastien is an experienced Agile coach with delivery and analysis history in different industries across Europe. He has a passion for making the workplace a place where people interact, talk to each other and deliver the right stuff. And do it with ambition and a sense of mastery and purpose. He is a keen sportsman with a few years of triathlon racing. Keen cyclist and runner, there are no places where he can’t find time to explore. He is a church leader for a small community church in Beeston and love spending time with his wife and three crazy (but lovable) children.\n",

      " We'll be sat downstairs at the back in \"the little kremlin room\". Are there more than two sexes? Is sex a spectrum or is it binary? Alice Roberts - president of the Humanists UK recently tweeted an article arguing that there has never been scientific consensus that there are simply two sexes:https://twitter.com/theAliceRoberts/status/1141091857193156608 Here's the link to the article:https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2015/feb/19/nature-sex-redefined-we-have-never-been-binary Colin Wright disagrees with this position and believes it's an example of the univariate fallacy. He argues that just because sex isn't attributable to just one variable, that doesn't mean that sex is a spectrum or that there are more than two sexes.https://twitter.com/SwipeWright/status/1124406797916409856 We'll be discussing what the best way to conceptualise sex is so if possible prior to the discussion please read the Guardian article and Colin Wright's thread responding to the reasoning. If people have chromosomes other than XX or XY does that mean they're a different sex? What's the best way to define how many sexes there are? Hormone level, chromosomes, gamete cells, or a combination of multiple variates?\n",

      " • What we'll do Guided Meditation- Opening the Heart to Infinite Love and Recognition of the Oneness of Life. Meditation is an ancient technique which aligns the body and mind in the present moment as we allow our inner sense of Presence to rise by simply BE-ing Aware. Suffering is caused by believing that we are separate from life, and that we exist as separate selves. Believing in ourselves as separate somebodies causes both inner and outer division.These Guided Meditations help to bring us back to this moment of Now and loosen the knots of beliefs , filters of conditioning in order to reveal our true nature. Guided Meditation supported with enquiry and observation helps you find relief from excessive thinking patterns common to stress, anxiety, and depression. Before attending this Meetup , you will be send some questions to see whether we are right for each other. This Meditation requires an openness and willingness to drop your head and dive into your Heart. Each Meeting starts with 30 to 40 minutes of Guided Meditation, followed by a short tea break (free) and an exploration/ discussion on Truth using various tools. Each Meeting ends with a 20 minute silent meditation. Guided Meditations are held on Tuesday Evenings at 6.45 pm to 8.45 ish pm in Eastbourne. Cost: £10 This is a small and intimate group and places are limited to 7 plus myself.To book your place email: [masked] Please arrive and leave quietly to deepen your connection with the Silence. Here is a good video to see the Benefits and Scientific Power of Meditation :https://youtu.be/Aw71zanwMnY • What to bring Wear what makes you feel comfortable and happy and if you are one that gets easily chilled – I suggest you also bring a wrap. • About Darshana: Darshana has spent most of the last 25 years on retreats, meditating in the UK, India, USA, identifying and observing mind patterns whilst attending many professional trainings as well as spiritual retreats, metaphysical and mindfulness trainings . She has gained an inner contentment and happiness that is regardless of her living circumstances. Her close association and friendship with Mooji and Ananta Kranti, and many of the better known Spiritual Teachers, has helped the never ending deepening, integration and embodiment of awakening.\n",

      " Its back to Southend for our annual August Bank Holiday trip to the coast. This time I'm including a walk, but anybody who can't or doesn't want to do that part of it, can meet us at the front of Southend Pier at 2pm. If you are coming on the walk, its outside Leigh-on-Sea station at 11.30am. Please do let me know if you are choosing the 2pm at the pier option. The route is from Leigh to Southend along the lovely coastal path. We'll go as far as Southchurch Park, and double back through the park to the pier. This makes the walk about 5 miles. The afternoon is for spending time around the pier/beach/amusements/ shops/rides (whatever floats boats, lol) and then head off to the pub for some food and drink. Get a C2C train (cheap as chips) from Fenchurch St, Limehouse, West Ham, Barking, Upminster, or further down the line if you live that way. There is also the odd train that goes from Liverpool St or Stratford and cuts over to Barking to get on to the Southend line. Buy a return to Southend Central, but hop off a couple back at Leigh-on-Sea if you're doing the walk. We will return from Southend station later - I'm planning on about 8pm, but you can, of course, leave when its right for you. The fare is about a tenner return. May be slightly more if you come from central London and less if you are a bit nearer. Remember that if you have free travel in London, or a daily/weekly/monthly/yearly travelcard that goes out far enough, you can buy your return at any ticket office to run from Upminster. You can also save money with railcards, and by travelling in groups of three or more. It looks like C2C are running a Sunday service on the day. There seems to be a train running from Liverpool St and then Stratford at 10.15am and 10.22am respectively. Please clarify this information though:https://www.c2c-online.co.uk/app/uploads/2019/05/Timetable_from_19_May_2019.pdf The usual nominal donation of £1 to help cover Meetup's subscription fee will apply. £1 coins only please. RISK WARNING/DISCLAIMER: Please remember that as with any physical activity, there can be dangers associated with hiking/walking, especially around waterways. Your decision to voluntarily participate in this activity is an informed decision. and by attending this event you agree and accept to take sole responsibility for your own actions, your own safety, and your own belongings. Please dress appropriately, including sturdy shoes. Please bring any necessary medication with you. You will need to be sufficiently fit to walk several miles at a moderate pace. We will cross or walk short distances on roads. INSURANCE: If either yourself or any guests you bring along require insurance for this walk, then you must arrange this yourselves. GUESTS: If you are bringing any guests along, there is no facility on the Meetup site to record their details. Please ensure that you make them fully aware of the Risk Warning, Disclaimer and Insurance statements.\n",

      " Get out, explore and enjoy London's abundant green spaces and surprising surrounding countryside, whilst making new friends in a group walk!! Give up the city streets for a day and breathe some fresh air. Improve your overall fitness levels, whilst chatting to new people during the walk and afterwards in a pub. Visit parts of London that you would not otherwise have an opportunity to see. Join us for a Saturday afternoon walk through some of West London's green areas, starting at Uxbridge Station, then soon joining and following the route of the River Pinn as it winds it way north towards Ruislip, where we enter Ruislip Woods and onto the secret beach (Ruislip Lido/Swimming Lake.) The walk will thus finish at 'The Waters Edge' pub/restaurant at the Ruislip Lido where the socialising can continue before heading back to central London. A short bus ride (bus stop immediately outside 'The Waters Edge' - bus number H13) will take you back to Ruislip and Ruislip Manor Stations. The Waters Edge offers good food including a carvery at a very reasonable price of approx. £7.50. Length of walk 6.5 miles = approx. 3 hours at a leisurely pace.

      " The tools that are available for the design of our buildings and infrastructure are becoming increasingly sophisticated and data-driven. The use of algorithmic simulation, machine learning and generative design not only vastly accelerates the traditional design process but opens new ways of working by increasing the ‘search area’ for ideas and generating far more possible solutions. This will have significant long-term impacts on clients and designers, placing far more emphasis on problem statements, developing ideas and outcomes, and less on deliverables and documents. This shift is happening as the manufacturing and construction converge. ‘Manufacture and assembly’, not ‘construction’, will tackle the endemic issues our industry faces. For over 2 decades Bryden Wood have been developing a highly sophisticated design and delivery methodologies for clients including GlaxoSmithKline, Heathrow Airport and many UK Government departments. We are all familiar with the idea that every car made by a manufacturer sits on a common chassis; in a similar way, construction platforms comprise components that can be used across sectors, so we can create the sort of repeatability and numbers where manufacturing techniques could be applied at scale. They generate high volume, constant demand for far fewer components which creates economies of scale. Components can be procured from a wide and diverse network of SME’s, seeing huge reductions in waste, and assembly can be done by workers after relatively brief training, creating new manufacturing jobs and skills. And of course, a platform approach supports advanced, digitally enabled workflows and plays to the strengths of ‘digital natives’; use of digital libraries also provides a repository for IoT sensor data, facilitates machine learning etc. This approach has been embraced by the public sector and forward thinking private sector clients. So what does this all mean? And what does this look like? Please sign up with the venue to ensure that you can gain entry: https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/12214-disruptive-innovation-what-it-really-means-to-the-construction-sector BIOHaving joined Bryden Wood, a tech-led team of designers in pursuit of value, shortly after the practice’s formation in 1995, Jaimie is responsible for the application of systems to the delivery and operation of truly high performing assets. This includes both physical DfMA systems and information systems (data analysis, digital delivery and BIM) for projects in the UK, Europe and Asia with clients including GlaxoSmithKline, Heathrow Airport and a number of government departments. As Head of Global Systems Jaimie is one of the UK’s leading thinkers on the future of industrialised construction. He was the author of the strategy documents ‘Delivery Platforms for Government Assets: Creating a Marketplace for Manufactured Spaces’, 'Platforms: Bridging the gap between construction + manufacturing' and 'Data Driven Infrastructure: From digital tools to manufactured components'. These have been adopted as a key articulation of the UK Government’s aspiration to adopt a more manufacturing-led approach to construction. This work was reflected in the Infrastructure and Project Authority’s call for evidence relating to the ‘proposed adoption of a Platform approach to Design for Manufacture and Assembly’ issued in November 2018. Jaimie is the Design Lead for the Construction Innovation Hub, which in late 2018 was awarded £72 million to drive innovation and technological advances in the UK construction and infrastructure sectors.\n",

The 14 Sep is a tentative date, that we can firm up once we have determined the level of interest. To this end, if you are interested, please sign up for the event as soon as possible, and by 30 July at the latest. We will aim for the early afternoon slots, and book adjacent slots if there are a number of us. Slots cannot be held, and there are only three customer skis per instructor, so the sooner we can book this event, the better!

THE GRANDSTAND ENCLOSURE Situated opposite the final furlong, the Grandstand Enclosure offers guests outstanding views of the racing, as well as easy access to the Parade Ring and Winner’s Enclosure. A variety of food and drink outlets are available on the first floor, whilst the highly acclaimed Racegoers Restaurant is on the second floor. Grandstand Enclosure & Racegoers RestaurantNo sportswear, bare chests or ripped/torn denim. Fancy dress is welcome though we reserve the right to refuse admission to anyone whose attire may cause offence or danger to other racegoers. If you can please RSVP by the beginning of June I will then be asking you for payment and booking the tickets. You will note that I have put RSVP 4 weeks before, as the site does not permit me to customize the date. It is a standing event We can arrange car-sharing between us nearer the time. There's plenty of car parking there , more details to follow nearer the time. We are not allowed to take our own food in, so we will just need to buy food as and where we want to in the many outlets. Cant wait this was such fun the other year, and this year it has the added bonus of live music by Madness later.\n",

      " Our regular Tuesday evening board-gaming meetup continues at The Sun of Camberwell, Coldharbour Lane, starting from 6:30pm. Please RSVP if you'd like to join in. We usually meet in the parlour, which is round the back of the pub. Head round to the right of the bar, through the dining area, and through the doorway on your left. We play a huge variety of modern board games, light and heavy, long and short, silly and serious, cooperative and competitive. If you're not familiar with the wide range of entertaining options that board-gaming has to offer, then this meetup is a great place to dive in. There's a whole cardboard world out there, just waiting to be explored. It's more vast than you might think. No matter how many fun times we have playing games, no matter how much joy in winning or hilarity in defeat we've had, there is always room for one more. We pride ourselves in being a welcoming club open to new members of all persuasions, tastes and levels of experience. Whether you're a seasoned gaming veteran or just branching out from your beat up Monopoly set with half the houses missing, you are welcome to join us at the table. If you are coming for the first time, then please RSVP below, and feel free to either leave a comment or message me and I will arrange your welcome and guarantee your satisfaction at being a part of our group. You can bring a game of your own if you have one you'd like to play, but there are usually plenty of games for a variety of tastes that our regulars bring along that you're welcome to try. I look forward to seeing you on Tuesday! :)-Michael\n",

      " Neural networks are used as a method of machine learning, one of the many subfields of artificial intelligence. They were first proposed around 70 years ago as an attempt at simulating the way the human brain works, though in a much more simplified form. In recent years, due to advancements in hardware development, we have been able to build very deep neural networks, and train them on enormous datasets to achieve breakthroughs in machine intelligence. In this class, you will implement a small subsection of image classification —digit recognition. Using Pytorch, an open-source Python library developed by Facebook, you will take hand-drawn images of the numbers 0-9 and build and train a neural network to recognise and predict the correct labels for the digits displayed. Prereq:* While you won't need prior experience in practical machine learning or Pytorch to follow along with this class, we'll assume some familiarity with Python programming language, high school linear algebra, and calculus - Checkout 3Blue1Brown videos on youtube to prepare for this class.* bring your laptop All other concepts will be explained in this class at a high level without diving into mathematical details which can be covered in future classes. This will be a hands-on class so please bring your laptop fully charged to build and train neural networks together. Spaces for this class will be limited. I'm pleased to confirm that Microsoft Reactor will kindly host us and sponsor staffing costs for this event.https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/#event/dayfrom/[masked]/id/B181EAA49F5924E16C772DCB718FCD0F Agenda:6:30-7:00pm: Check-in & Refreshments7:00-8:30pm: lecture and code labs8:30: Networking & close This workshop is jointly hosted with London AI Tech Talks meetup group (https://www.meetup.com/London-AI-Tech-Talk/) and sponsored by Microsoft.\n",

Bring yourself, your laptop/paper and pen, buy a drink and get some work done on your own current project. If you don't have something on the go, Lauren will have some writing prompts and tools available for you to play around with - you never know, they might just inspire your next work of art! Look for a table of writerly types - we'll be the ones with laptops at a pub! - and come and say hi.

Get your ticket at:https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/restless-london-1-a-graphql-meetup-tickets-64971643936 Please take a moment to sign up on Eventbrite! In case we are over capacity, we can only admit ticket holders! -- GraphQL is transforming the way systems and teams communicate with each other. RESTless London is a meetup dedicated to all things GraphQL. For our first event, we've got a fantastic speaker lineup of both local and international experts on GraphQL. This event is free and open for anyone interested in GraphQL. Some talks may require previous knowledge about the topic to fully appreciate, but everyone is welcome! Good to know: * Food and drink, including vegetarian and non-alcoholic, provided.* Doors open 6:00pm, first talk begins at 7:00pm -- Talks APOLLO SCHEMA FEDERATIONJames Baxley, Engineering Manager @ Apollo GraphQL allows organizations to expose their data in a single graph, instead of as independent endpoints that require clients to be aware of service boundaries and to follow relationships between entities manually. Defining and deploying your data graph in a monolithic schema doesn’t scale however. As GraphQL adoption within an organization grows, schema design shifts from being a single team responsibility to being an organization-wide concern. In this talk, I will introduce Apollo schema federation which is the evolution of schema stitching. - MAKING OF URQLPhil Pluckthun, Technology Lead @ Formidable London Urql is a lightweight, batteries-included GraphQL client library that aims to make interfacing with GraphQL servers easy, without sacrificing flexibility as your app grows. Even the oldest GraphQL libraries are only a few years old, and we haven't found the optimal solutions, yet. In this talk, Phil, one of urql's core contributors, explains what sets it apart from other libraries such as Apollo and Relay, and how urql can foster experimentation across the entire GraphQL client community. - SCALING GRAPHQL BEYOND A BACKEND FOR FRONTENDMichelle Garrett & Faduma Faralacag, Condé Nast Michelle and Faduma are Software Engineers at Condé Nast, building a (very high fashion) GraphQL API to serve content for brands like Vogue and GQ. They share a passion for GraphQL, JavaScript, lipstick and Beyoncé. What happens when the GraphQL layer you built as a Backend For Frontend (BFF) now needs to serve multiple consumers? How do you scale your GraphQL API beyond a single consumer, and abstract effectively to serve all your clients’ data needs? This talk will share the experience of transitioning a BFF GraphQL API into a more generic schema, navigating the tension between building something client-specific and client-agnostic. It’ll evaluate the best strategies for consuming a shared GraphQL API without compromising on client-specific concerns and data needs. You'll leave with an understanding of the challenges involved in scaling a GraphQL API beyond a single consumer, and an idea of how to transition your architecture to support this. -- RESTless London is an open and inclusive event for everyone. We follow and enforce the Berlin Code of Conduct. If you think someone violated this Code of Conduct, or you have any questions, please contact jani at formidable dot com or speak to any of the organisers at the venue -- Thank you to our sponsors, Formidable and Monzo! ❤️\n",

Bring yourself, your laptop/paper and pen, buy a drink and get some work done on your own current project. If you don't have something on the go, Lauren will have some writing prompts and tools available for you to play around with - you never know, they might just inspire your next work of art! Look for a table of writerly types - we'll be the ones with laptops at a pub! - and come and say hi. Stay for the whole session, or pop in for as long as you can, but please RSVP so Lauren knows how many to book a table for. Contact her or Sutton Writers via meetup if you have any questions. Hope to see you there!\n",

      " Join us for a relaxing 2 or 3 nights weekend city break in Krakow.  EARLY BIRD BOOKING PRICEIF YOU PAID BEFORE[masked]. THE PRICES ARE:£189 for 2 nights or £259 for 3 nights Krakow, one of the oldest cities in Poland has been its capital for seven centuries and represents an eclectic mix of many styles of architecture. In recognition of its value, Krakow has been among the first cities declared a UNESCO World Heritage in 1978. Krakow is sometimes called Rome of the North as there are 120 churches and convents in the city. The most famous of them is the Mariacki church, boasting largest Gothic altarpiece in the world. The Jagiellonian University, founded in 1364 is the second oldest in this part of Europe.But Krakow is much more than a tourist destination. It's a city of culture, proud of its theatres and museums as well as a vibrant student city with rich nightlife. Whether you enjoy discovering narrow streets of a medieval city with its nooks and crannies, visiting fascinating monuments or trying out local food and drinks, Krakow has it all. HIGHLIGHTS: - Krakow Old City UNESCO site - Jewish District UNESCO site - Wieliczka Salt Mine UNESCO site - Christmas Market at the Main Square - all this presented by our crew member Weronika, originally from Krakow - if you stay till 10.12. Auschwitz Museum  The trip is suitable for every fitness level. It will involve a fair deal of walking to explore the city and its surroundings but there will be plenty of time to wander around on your own and enjoy the Christmas Market as well as a lively nightlife. Since we'll be there in winter time you could expect temperatures slightly above or below zero. Our guide will be Weronika, our team member and a yoga teacher who was born in Krakow and has lived there for most of her life.  SATURDAYThe recommended flight will arrive at Krakow Balice Airport at 12.05 pm.Making the most of the first day, we will leave from Balice airport straight to Wieliczka- a small town 20 minutes drive from Krakow where we'll have lunch. The highlight of the day will be visiting Wieliczka Salt Mine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The salt mine had been continuously in use since the 13th century up until 2007 which makes it one of the oldest salt mines in the world! We will walk down 800 steps to get 135 meters underground and experience a 3 hour long trip of wonders. The mine features an underground lake, a chapel, historic statues, mythical figures carved out of rock salt and even rock salt chandeliers.   After checking in and refreshing at the hotel Regent in Krakow's Jewish District, we'll have a meal at the hotel.  If you still have energy, after the dinner you could check out Krakow's nightlife scene. It'd be worth to check one of the trendy 'vodka and snack' bars. SUNDAYWe will spend most of Sunday exploring unhurriedly the Old City with all its landmarks: city walls with Florianska gate, the Main Square (the largest medieval square in Europe!), old university buildings and the Wawel Royal Castle standing tall at the banks of the Vistula river. We will stop over for a quick lunch at a restaurant located in the atmospheric cellars of the historical building.   We shall finish the trip around 4 pm in Main Square. It would be a perfect opportunity to spend some time at the Christmas Market, buy souvenirs (such as beautiful Polish ceramics) or simply relax in one of the innumerable atmospheric cafes. We will all meet again in the evening and go out for a meal at a traditional Polish Highlanders restaurant. You'll get a chance to try some regional dishes, entertained by a band playing traditional folk music.  MONDAYOn the last day, we will have a walk through the medieval Kazimierz district, which used to be divided into Christian and Jewish zones. We will focus mostly on exploring Jewish Kazimierz with its 7 synagogues and one of the oldest Jewish graveyards in Europe. Due to its uniqueness as a religious complex, Kazimierz was declared a UNESCO Heritage Site. The walk will finish at lunchtime at one of Szeroka Street's atmospheric restaurants serving East European Jewish dishes. That will still leave you plenty of time to explore the city on your own or simply relax in one of the numerous cosy cafes in Kazimierz- the most bohemian and fashionable part of the city.   We will all meet again in the evening to collect the luggage from the hotel and leave for the airport. ACCOMMODATION We will be based in twin rooms at the 3- star Hotel Regent, located in a historical building at the heart of the Jewish district, just 10 minutes from the Royal Castle. The entire property has wireless internet. There is an option to have a massage at the hotel, charged extra. PRICE of £219 INCLUDES: - 2 nights in a 3* hotel within 10 mins walk from the Wawel Castle, accommodation in twin rooms - 2 breakfasts - airport pick up and drop off (recommended flights only) - transport to/from Wieliczka Salt Mine - Financial Consumer Protection according to Package Holidays and Tours Regulations 1992 - guiding during the trip by Polish native speaker - Weronika, originally from Krakow PRICE DOES NOT INCLUDE: -flights-entrance to the sights in Krakow (£4)- entrance to Wieliczka Salt Mine (£18)-lunches (£7-9) and dinners (£9-13) YOU MAY HAVE A SINGLE ROOM FOR £70 EXTRA FOR 3 NIGHTS; £50 - 2 nights, please email to [masked] if you are interested.  EXTRA NIGHT There will be an option to stay one night and one day longer for an extra cost of £70 per person. If you have time you may buy cheaper flight returning on Tuesday and spend more time exploring Krakow and the area. Organisers will be staying for 3 nights and we may plan our time according to group preferences. There are many attractions in and around Krakow. You could make a whole day trip to Auschwitz- Birkenau Concentration Camp Museum and Memorial, 60 km away from a city.As a lighter alternative, you could spend the day outdoors. Ojcowski National Park, famous for its lime rock formations, tranquil valleys and castles is just 30 minutes drive from Krakow.  If you preferred to stay in Krakow, you could explore Nowa Huta district - entire urban complex built in soc-realistic style. Our crew member Weronika is from Nowa Huta and she would be happy to show you places where you can still feel and see the remnants of the communist era. Schindler's Factory is a modern, interactive museum showing the real history of Schindler's List most known from Steven Spielberg's 90's movie. Rynek Underground Exhibition shows how looked the life in Krakow in medieval times.

      " This was a great walk to recce with a very nice pub afterwards but please consider your capabilities before signing up as it is a challenging one with plenty of significant ascent and descent to go with the multiple panoramic views !! We start from the pay & display car park located on the r.h.s. immediately as you enter Newton-under-Roseberry (if travelling from the south). Car park is £4.50 with free toilets. The postcode is TS9 6QS. Almost immediately, we start the ascent to the top of Roseberry Topping at an elevation of 1,051'. A gently ascending track soon climbs steeply as we enter woodland with a flight of 90 steps to help us on our way. After completing this climb, there is a bench (for those who need it!!) before we embark on another steep climb of similar length. A solid rocky path resumes the ascent before we emerge from woodland for the first of many panoramic views - and another bench to sit on!! On we climb to the top of the hill before taking a break and considering our ongoing route that we can see clearly before us. The initial section of the walk from the car park to the top of Roseberry Topping will take 45mins. A steep descent is followed by a level section before we climb again, although nowhere near as challenging as the first climb. We then have another level section before a gentle descent brings us to our lunch stop in a picnic area surrounded ny trees. The walk from top of the Topping to our lunch location is two miles and I anticipate lunch break being around 12.30. After lunch, yet another ascent brings us up to the Cpt. Cook Monument, which stands at 51' tall amid more appealing panorama's of the area. Having resumed our walk, we enter more woodland and a steep but enjoyable descent ultimately passing through a small settlement before we climb up a quiet road taking us into yet more woodland and then a short steep climb onto the top of the surrounding area, past the likely site of Cpt. Cook's family home and over the other side of the ridge for a drop into woodland where you might like to have a framed photo taken of yourself (!?!). An undulating path which drops down to a final level section gives us an easy stroll back to the car park and well-earned refreshment. The Kings Arms Inn is within walking distance of the car park. This is a large but pleasant pub with three outside seating areas, a view of Roseberry Topping and a local walker told me the food is good here too if you were so inclined. The walk will be led at a steady pace: not too fast, not too slow. Please be ready to start walking at the advertised time. Walk fee £3. No dogs please. Bring a packed lunch/drink/snacks with you. IF ITS A WARM DAY, PLEASE ENSURE YOU BRING PLENTY OF LIQUID REFRESHMENT. I have no formal walk leader or first-aid qualifications and the Group does not have insurance. When you RSVP for any walk, you accept that you remain responsible for your own safety at all times. You are required to respect the walk leader and be mindful of the safety of others. Please keep to the pace of the group and don't go off ahead even if you think you know the route.\n",

      " These sessions are particularly aimed at girls/women from the age of 18 who are looking to improve their game in a safe, structured and nurturing environment without men. The emphasis of these sessions tend to be training/coaching based so people can feel more confident about the game with movement as well as racket skills. What is unique with this session is that we have a good range of standards (from improvers to match players) which means people will always find a suitable sparring partner who will be able to push them to improve. This particular session is unsuitable for absolute beginners. We are fully qualified coaches so have public liability insurance and will provide all equipment (rackets and shuttles) if required. For those who have not been to the centre just go to the barrier and ask reception to let you in. Tell them you have a badminton session at 12pm. Please make contact with me directly to arrange payment of £20 through bank transfer before the session. This ensures your place is secured as payment has been made in advance. If you don't make payment before the session (even though you have RSVP for the session) it does not mean your place is secured and you will run the risk of it being full up by the day. This deters people RSVP for the session and not showing up. Qualified Badminton England Coach\n",

      " In the Iron Age the capital of the Atrebates tribe, Calleva became an important Roman town, until its abandonment in the 5th-Cent and return to nature.

Distance 13 miles / 21 km Outward Travel: Take the train departing 9:59 AM from London Paddington to Mortimer. Beforehand from 9.30 AM the organiser will be easy to spot near the ticket office, wearing a bright yellow shirt or coat, as a focal point to gather so you can arrange GroupSave tickets.

It is not organized by a business nor any entity with commercial purposes.Any trip details, travel advice, route planning, instructions and other content in our group merely represent our shared personal knowledge, research and suggestions as outdoor enthusiasts. As this is no business, there is no \"product\", \"service\" or \"package\" and also no \"tour guide\", \"operator\" or \"walk leader\".Each participant is responsible for their own safety. Even if some of us are very experienced walking outdoors, nobody assumes responsibility for any kind of injury, damage or loss that may happen.Despite this, we take extreme precautions and all trips we plan are very safe, fun, highly educational and popular. Our experienced members volunteer their time and effort to shape a pleasant and quality adventure for everyone :-)By participating you acknowledge and agree with this disclaimer. Here are our tips on staying safe during outdoor trips:http://www.meetup.com/Free-Outdoor-Trips-From-London/about/ TRAVEL, ACCOMMODATION, INSURANCEAlthough we provide detailed suggestions, each participant is expected to arrange their own travel and (if required) accommodation - this gives everyone the freedom and choice to join from wherever they want and stay wherever they want. Anyone interested in travel or outdoor insurance should also arrange this on their own. As mentioned above we always take extreme precautions, but some people may still feel safer if covered.As most of our trips are confirmed or postponed very close to the event date - heavily depending on the weather forecasts - we advise not to buy this until the last minute. People getting tickets from the same station are encouraged to meet early on the day to benefit from discounts such as GroupSave. ABOUT THE GROUPThis Meetup group was founded by a few friends in London, where we put together day walks - they attracted so many people that we decided to share our hobby with a broader audience hence we created this new group!

      " The Gloucester Agile workshop will be kicking off at the Fountain Inn Gloucester on the 23rd July 2019! We have two great speakers Suzanne Doyle and Rhos Chappelle, come along and check them out! Agenda: 6-6:30pm - Meet and drinks6:30-7:15 - Suzanne Doyle7:15-7:45 - Q&A and Networking7:45-8:30 - Rhos Chappelle8:30-9pm - Q&A and Networking Suzanne Doyle Presents: Travelling Cloak: A Journey to the Powerfully Unknown Is your Scaled Agile working? Super energise Tribe and squads through trying on the travelling cloak. One of the biggest issues we have witnessed is squads having no connection to other squads in a Tribe, and Tribe leadership having limited to no connection with the squads. The learning pathways are blocked and tend to get into a toxic pattern – ‘it’s not my fault, it is Fred’s’. There is a blaming pattern and stonewalling going on. Through this exercise, we will take participants on an incredible journey that they can take away to connect across squads in a Tribe to reach powerful new levels of collaboration. You can apply this to departments too. We have tried out some methods and the Lands work from ORSC (Organisation and Relationship Systems Coaching) is incredible, to quickly build Trust through Empathy and get into action. This is for individuals to stretch into a new awareness about how other people perceive reality. When one can cross the edge and step outside one’s held position, culture, expectations and stand in the shoes of a person in a different reality, then there is the true possibility for new insights and personal growth. About Suzanne Doyle: Passionate about creating the right environment for high-performance teams and leadership to make change successful in organisations. She started off as a IT developer for many years, moved to Program Management and then onto leading Business and IT transformation and later into coaching.

Scale is no longer enough. Large enterprises need to work as a collection of smaller, faster and adaptive companies in order to survive.

      " OXFORD INVENTORS MEETUP AGENDA 7:00pm - Arrival7:15pm - Talk7:45pm - Q&A8:15pm - Social / refreshments9:00pm - Lighthouse pubCost: FREE A) TALK Talk title: \"What is 'Industry 4.0' and what are the opportunities for private inventors?\" Speakers: RICH HUGHES & STEVE SAMUELS, Directors at THINK ENGINEER – the specialist IoT developers and prototype engineers. Synopsis: In this talk, we will introduce the concept of “Industry 4.0” and the opportunities it presents to inventors and innovators looking to make an impact. Details:We will discuss concepts such as:• The Internet of Things (IoT)• M2M communications• Cloud computing• Machine learning and AI algorithms• Cyber-physical systems...and how they are empowering individuals and businesses to make smarter decisions and increase productivity and efficiency. The talk will give examples of trends and opportunities in different industries enabled by new technologies. This will demonstrate the breadth of new inventions being applied across varied domains. We will share some insight into how these technologies may affect how industries will operate in the future. We will also examine how innovators can use rapid prototyping techniques such as:• 3D printing• CNC milling• Combining off-the-shelf components• Electronic prototyping...to develop new ideas for even complex systems on a budget, to prove their ideas and lay the groundwork for either licensing or producing their solutions. The talk will also briefly touch on the IP landscape as it applies to industry 4.0 solutions. About the Speakers:RICH and STEVE both attended Master’s courses in Artificial Intelligence and Cybernetics at the University of Reading. After getting frustrated with the slow-paced, risk-averse culture of working in a multinational tech company, Steve and Rich joined forces to form Think Engineer, a technology design and development company focusing on the Internet of Things. STEVE SAMUELS has a breadth of technical skills which include a development of hardware, software, algorithms and complete systems design. Steve has also been involved in writing patent applications for systems that he has helped to design. RICH HUGHES’s key technical expertise includes machine learning, Googling things, and designing complex IoT based systems. Rich also has technical skills such as printed circuit board design, software implementation, and data analysis. Both have been involved in delivering cutting-edge, innovative projects. B) SOCIAL Following a Q&A session with Rich and Steve, the second half of the evening will be an informal chat where you can meet: • Fellow inventors of new products• Startup entrepreneurs• Angel investors• Prospective suppliers It will be a chance to meet private individuals with 'world-beating' highly inventive ideas for new commercial products, who are in need business partners. It will also be a chance to swap ideas and general advice in a friendly, informal but professional environment and to chat informally with Rich and Steve about your particular circumstances. We look forward to seeing you! * * * What is Oxford Inventors Meetup (OIM)? Oxford Inventors meetup group is primarily for entrepreneurial inventors of new physical products – at whatever stage of development – who are seeking to commercialise their product ideas. Our aim is to help fellow inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs to meet, engage in lively discussion, share candid advice and support each other and thereby make our ideas actually happen. The following types of people:• New product inventors & innovators• Startup entrepreneurs• Angel investors (early stage)• Product designers ...plus prospective suppliers such as:• IP professionals• Mechanical & software engineers• Model-makers• Graphic designers• Marketing professionals and other creative people...are all invited to join this group. We foster professionalism, trust and support. If any of that sounds like you, come along and have a chat\n",

Regardless of our best intentions, there will come a point where all our carefully laid out technical decisions are made redundant.

Or maybe we sign up, but then let 'any excuse' mean we don't actually go? It's raining, I'm tired, that DVD box set won't watch itself? But why not actually TRY it? This is a class for all levels - some of us are beginners, while others have more experience, but everyone is welcome. It consists of games and scenes all improvised by the people that come along. Sometimes it ends up a bit mad but other times you can be surprised by the theatre that comes out of nowhere. We start off every class with warm ups and progress depending upon how we all feel, and mostly just have a laugh with a few drinks. There is no pressure to perform first time, so if you want to just watch, see what we are about and how the classes run that's fine too. At the moment we have rotating hosts, so you get the benefit of different teaching styles and a mixture of exercises and games. The classes run every MONDAY 7-9pm, at The St. James Wine Vaults (upstairs), which is just behind Royal Crescent. There are a number of people who attend through Facebook rather than Meetup, so even if the numbers signed up on Meetup look low the class will still definitely be on, and we normally have around 7-12 people attending. There is also plentiful free street parking on nearby Julian Road and Weston Road, or in the park. Please note there is a voluntary £2 donation towards room costs, though your first time is FREE!\n",

      " Another weekend based at Achnasheen for some more far north / Toridonian fun. See the photos from May 2015 s trip for inspiration!!!! Friday through to Sunday. Ordnance Survey map 25, Car park map ref[masked] & Inver Croft map ref[masked] There is a lot of scope for riding in this area, at all levels of expertise - or not, although if you are not going on the ride that I'll be leading, you will need to be able to read a map... On the Saturday, we'll have a full hard days biking - probably not for novices as it is likely to be a \"Hard/Epic\" ride circa 20/30miles with plenty of height thrown in. The rides cut through wild and uninhabited upland areas, riders should be self sufficient -- not that we would leave people behind -- breaking down means on site repair or a long walk out. If sufficient people request an easier or different ride, and, we can find another leader we can have a couple of rides on Saturday - in parallel, but the area demands that all leaders can competently read a map, and use a compass. Accommodation: Jacobites MC Club hut near Achnasheen for the weekend of Saturday 20th May. Cost ~£7.5 per night. The area is great for mountain biking with Torridon on its doorstep and the Contin trails only about 25 mins away. I will post more details of other rides nearer the time. The idea is to arrive at Inver Friday evening, ride Saturday and Sunday, leaving for home late Sunday afternoon. There is a well appointed kitchen - no microwave!!, lounge and drying room. So bring your own food to cook - unless there is a will to cook as a group...... You will need a sleeping bag.Any questions just ask. I would suggest that we take as few cars as we can to keep costs down - I have three bike racks and so can take two passengers from Edinburgh.Remember Usual rule - over 18s only, helmet mandatory and signing up indicates that you understand the risks inherent to cycling and take responsibility for your own safety.Cheers\n",

It is a natural and ancient plant medicine, with a high concentration of vitamins, minerals and is a powerful antioxidant. Cacao also increases blood flow (oxygen and nutrients) to the brain as well as induces the release of feel-good endorphins. Cacao ceremonies are a type of shamanic healing – which is one of the oldest holistic healing practices used by indigenous cultures all over the world. These types of healing ceremonies work with rebalancing energies in the body to regain health. However, unlike other shamanic experiences, drinking cacao will not make you hallucinate or give you some sort of ‘out-of-body’ psychedelic experience. Cacao instead, is used to gently touch your heart and to guide you into an inner journey deep into the emotional center of our body – our heart (Anahata) chakra.

Before we will also do aromatherapy to calm our minds and prepare us better for experience. Tibetan Singing Bowls will be put on the body for deeper experience of vibration. They are specially certified by Peter Hess (creator of sound massage) for that use. The vibrational effects of Sound Healing Massages on a person’s body, mind and energy flow is an incredible inner journey everyone should experience. Tibetan singing bowls can generate a type of energy vibration to help you to reduce stress, heal pain or depression and create a deep sense of peace, well being and better health. For centuries, the Indian and Tibetan people have practiced sound healing and consciousness transformation with “singing bowls.” They are a quintessential aid to meditation, and can be found in temples, monasteries and meditation halls throughout the world. What are the benefits?After sessions clients can experience improved memory, clarity, vitality and the ability to take action. Many report a deep sense of tranquility, sleep soundly and feel the effects of the treatment for several days. • Relaxation, deep sleep• Drainage• Rejuvenation• Support for healing for various health and emotional issues• Meditation• Balanced chakras• Increased life force energy• Mental clarity• Relief of chronic fatigue syndrome and depression• Pain relief management and side effects especially for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy (consult your physician for agreement)• Reduce pain and discomfort from fibromyalgia• Lower blood pressure (consult your physician for agreement) What to expect from a session?After a holistic health assessment, Tibetan singing bowls are placed on different parts of the body while being chimed. Other bowls might also be used surrounding the body to create varying notes and vibrations. The vibrations, like acupuncture needles, are amazingly efficient to help vital energy flow freely. This way people can disconnect from their worry and experience the present moment. Results can vary from a deep sense of relaxation, to relief from physical and/or emotional pain, a sensation of lightness as the body lets go of past emotional and physical issues. After sessions we will have short silent meditation, circle with sharing experiences (not necessary) and we will finish after enjoying delicious vegan dinner.

      " Who needs protection from what? How do we protect them? We'll explore some intertwined concepts including vulnerability, individual freedom, nanny-state-ism, exploitation and taboos/social blind spots. In particular, we'll consider those who are less able to make \"good\" decisions for themselves – or at least who don't behave in ways which others might deem to be in their own best interests, given their circumstances. We look around us and observe a huge variation in the capacity of people for reasoned thought and behavioural choices. At one end of the spread we observe people we describe as \"intelligent\" or \"incisive\" who make \"rational\" decisions to take best advantage of their abilities and circumstances. We generally consider them \"successful\" in some sense. At the other end ... we struggle with adjectives. We avoid words such as \"slow\" or \"unintelligent\" in favour of words such as \"deprived\" or \"vulnerable\" or \"poor\". Why is this? To what extent is there a causal link between those deemed \"less intelligent\" and those deemed \"vulnerable/deprived/poor\". The topic under discussion is not so much about inequality of educational opportunity, quality of parenting, and inherited wealth, (important though these are). Instead we will focus more on the inherent genetic inequalities, and in particular differences in mental abilities between people. Even if everyone had identical parenting, education, and financial help, some would fare \"better\" than others. How, and how much, should society attempt to compensate for this? To what extent should society interfere with an individual's freedom of choice – even if they make decisions others consider ill-advised or sub-optimal for themselves? How much do we (or at least some of us) need a \"nanny state\"? Elements of society can ruthlessly exploit those who are vulnerable in the sense being considered. Loan sharks and advertisers are obvious examples. Gambling and drugs are controlled to some extent, to avoid excessive exploitation. Modern life itself can penalise those who are not able to respond \"appropriately\" due to limited abilities with language, arithmetic, IT or internet skills. This can apply even to those aspects of society set up to help the vulnerable, as the film I Daniel Blake showed. Do we go far enough to limit the exploitation? Do we go far enough to offer the right sort of help? Do we even know what \"the right sort of help\" is? We protect children from alcohol. We strongly discourage smoking. Councils put up signs warning of the dangers of cliff edges… Where should personal autonomy end and “care” begin? When should the nanny-state be reigned in? What are the grounds for deciding that someone is “vulnerable” and needs “protection”, as compared with someone who is “differently-abled” and makes decisions others might consider sub-optimal or ill-advised? What sorts of things do “vulnerable” people need protection from? How is the line drawn between “nudging” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nudge_theory and subliminal manipulation https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/ads-with-subliminal-messages ? How can “experts” be sure they are right, eg in nutritional matters? Is it possible in any culture for society to organise without exploitation of people? One example of how society very clearly sets some boundaries in defining “vulnerability” and the degree to which people should be protected against making decisions others think of as “unwise” is in the right to refuse medical treatment. \"Mentally competent\" people’s decisions are upheld even if this is likely to be fatal, and against the strong advice of their medical team. See the case of the champagne suicide for example: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34985442 Join us to respectfully discuss a wide-ranging and emotive topic guaranteed to elicit a range of interesting experience and opinion from Café Philo members.\n",

      " ***EXCLUSIVE LIVE EVENT IN BIRMINGHAM*** Do you seriously want to achieve your goals & transform your reality? Do you wake up in the mornings and your life is \"same old\"? Have you previously tried to make a positive change in your life without success, leaving you feeling frustrated, lost & unfulfilled? You may have a secret desire to better yourself, your career, your income & give your family a better lifestyle. ........... Now, just imagine... If you could have anything in life, what would it be? How much more money would you love to earn? What kind of home would you like to live in? How often would you go away? See, unfortunately most people never give any serious thought to these areas in life, nor are they taught to. Imagine a life with no restrictions. Waking up excited about your day ahead. Feeling satisfied & fulfilled with your results. Imagine never, ever having to worry about time or money. ........... I don’t claim to know exactly what your goals and dreams looks like. But I do know how you can achieve it! You see, goal achievement is an art. ........... The Science of Goal Achievement dates back centuries, and has been used by the most successful people including Rockefeller, Thomas Edison, Andrew Carnegie (the richest man in the world at the time) and is followed by today's leading Entrepreneurs including Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Bill Gates & others. Imagine if you could: • Improve any area of your life to have better income, a career change, a job promotion, a new home, an improved business, weight loss, better health or improved personal relationships • Make a quantum leap by breaking free from everything holding you back & learn how to upgrade your mindset to a winner's one, to achieve anything you truly want • Multiply your income continuously so that you can travel more & provide the lifestyle that you and your family deserve • Empower yourself to break free from fear & worry to begin operating on a successful mindset like the highest achievers • Completely eradicate PROCRASTINATION and TAKE ACTION ........... Imagine breaking FREE and ACHIEVING more in the next 6 months of your life than you have ever done?........... About Me (Your Host) • My name is Mindy Paul and I started completely broke, working 14-hour days, 7 days a week before transforming my life after recovering from the brink of death in 2016 • After being personally mentored by the world's #1 teacher in wealth & success creation, Bob Proctor, I turned my annual income into my monthly income within weeks using this same information which I will share with you • Today, I am blessed to work with clients and organisations all over the world, every single day, as an International Success Mentor by teaching them the science of success & goal achieving • Helping others to find their true meaning in life and create an abundant life from it, is something I am very passionate about! I get results that STICK. If you'd love to learn how, then you must clear your calendar for this event and invite anyone you believe also wants this for their lives ........... To become a goal achiever, you must have a clearly defined goal, have a list of action steps to work towards daily and refuse to let anything distract you from it. The problem is most people set & go after goals the wrong way. If you want different results, you need to ignite change at the level where your results are created in the first place – in your thinking. When you do that, achieving your goals becomes not merely “possible” or “probable” … It becomes INEVITABLE. The life altering content you will experience at this seminar hasn't been created by me. Our teachings are based on more than 150 years of real-life experience & tremendous success. I personally learned it from my mentor Bob Proctor & I'm passing on this information to as many people as I can, so we can all move towards an amazing future together. I look forward to seeing you there! -Mindy\n",

About the walkOn this walk we explore Whitechapel to hear about East End gangsters, reformers and radicals. A notorious siege, a gangland shooting, two renowned nurses and the birth of a world wide religious movement are just some of the subjects covered. We’ll see the “monster doss house” where down and outs unknowingly mixed with men who would shape history, the hospital where the “Elephant Man “ stayed under the supervision of the King’s Surgeon Sir Frederick Treves, the hidden statue of a Queen , a mosque, a former synagogue, a German church, 17th century almshouses and a renowned art gallery to name just a few elements of the tour. The walk is a private walk for the group, we will split into 2 groups and we will be guided by Rachel Kolsky (2:00pm) & Diane Burstein (2:15pm). It will last about 2 hours. Cost for the guided walk is £8 per person for Full Members of the group and £10 per person for everyone else (payable on the day).To become a Full Member, go to: www.meetup.com/london_cultureseekers/dues Afterwards we will head to the Blind Beggar pub, 337 Whitechapel Road (nearest tube: Whitechapel) for a chat over a drink.

You’ll cover the basics, whilst leading up to life-saving skills such as bearings, dead reckoning, dog legging/boxing, relocation, aspects, triangulation and micro nav for poor visibility. This is a free course taught by a qualified Mountain Leader and will not be a regular event. Ray has additional maps & compasses to lend but you’ll have to arrange with him prior to the day.

If the bus is running late, please text Ray on[masked] so he won’t leave without you. https://bustimes.org/services/s6-bangor-pass What is “personal hiking equipment”? This varies from person to person and you should check the weather forecast when deciding. You’ll need shoes suitable for walking the terrain (ideally hiking boots) and appropriate clothing (no jeans!). Always bring a waterproof jacket (a cheap rain mac may suffice) and consider a hat and additional layers. Sun cream is required surprisingly often, potentially even on cloudy summer days. Bring food and at least 1 litre of water (even 2 litres will go on a long hot day!).\n",

      " Meet, greet, mingle and play - Welcome to the Berlin Geek meetup! deutsch und englisch willkommen :) Doors open at 19:00 but feel free to join during the evening! We set up small groups to play board or card games (feel free to bring a game you'd specifically like to play! The venue holds many games as well) or just hang out, have a drink and talk! Interface Bar also has a Kicker Table, Consoles and PCs but boardgames are the best, right?! We would love for everyone to socialise throughout the evening, so the main aim of these games is to get to know the other people at the table! Don't worry if you've never heard of our games before or if you're a bit nervous about coming along. We have a team member present to welcome you into the group and we're really looking forward to seeing you at the meetup! --nochmal auf deutsch-- Nach kurzer Begrüßungsrunde liegt dir die Abendgestaltung frei; entweder schließt du dich einer kleineren Gruppe an, um ein Spiel zu spielen oder tummelst dich einfach mit den anderen Leuten, lernst sie kennen und quatscht z.B. ein bisschen über dieses oder jenes Gaming-thema. Keine Sorge, falls du die Spiele nicht kennst oder nicht alle Star Trek Charaktere auswendig weißt oder vielleicht generell etwas nervös bist, ins Unbekannte zu stolpern. Wir haben ein Teammitglied vor Ort um dich Willkommen zu heißen und ggf. Spielregeln zu erläutern.Wir freuen uns einfach auf dein Dasein und hoffen, dass auch du Spaß haben wirst. *** ATTENTION ~ Bitte beachten! Interface house-rules Everyone has to be at least 18 of age and order a drink (there is a vast variety of non-alcoholic and alcoholic drinks to choose from), aside from that everything on location is free and you can bring your own food, if you'd like to. Alle müssen 18 sein und Getränke (es gibt diverse nicht-alkoholische und alkoholhaltige Optionen) bestellen, ansonsten ist aber alles kostenlos und Essen könnt ihr mitbringen oder euch in die Bar bestellen, wenn ihr möchtet.\n",

      " Was passiert, wenn man Agiles Arbeiten und Coworking kreuzt? Das haben wir einfach mal ausprobiert und waren selbst überrascht: Es wird produktiv.Und gesellig dazu. Was macht das Coworking Agil? Wir arbeiten im 5/50/5er Takt im kollektiven Kreislauf von Stillarbeit und Sprechzeit (Dash-and-Crash) ; aber du kannst kommen und gehen wann du willst. Um jede volle Stunde gibt es eine 10 Minuten Sprechzeit: 09:00 bis 09:05 - Sprechzeit (Warmup Crash)09:05 bis 09:55 - Stillarbeit (Dash)09:55 bis 10:00 - Sprechzeit (Cooldown Crash) 10:00 bis 10:05 - Sprechzeit (Warmup Crash)10:05 bis 10:55 - Stillarbeit (Dash)10:55 bis 11:00 - Sprechzeit (Cooldown Crash) usw ... Während der Stillarbeit gilt Ruhe - wie in der UniBib. In der Sprechzeit jedoch natürlich keine Sprechpflicht, aber man kann frei Netzwerken, sich austauschen oder einfach antizyklisch durcharbeiten. Die gemeinsame Konzentration motiviert und fokussiert spürbar vom ersten Dash an. Richtig agil wird es, wenn man sich pro Dash ein oder zwei Ziele setzt, die man auch in diesem Dash erfüllen will (Agiles Timeboxing). Nach jedem Dash evaluiert man den Gesamtfortschritt sowie den Status Quo kurz und plant die nächsten Dashes um - zB um zwischenzeitliche neue Aufgaben einzutakten, etc. (Agile Repriorisierung) Dabei wird Umschalten zwischen Dash und Crash, Konzentration und Entspannung, durch das Coworken zu einem natürlichen und leicht erlernbaren Vorgang. (Agile Taktung) Wie funktioniert das? Getaktet wird das ganze durch einen digitalen Gong einer WebApp, die wir eigens dafür programmiert haben: https://cowohrking.flowrakis.de Komm einfach jederzeit vorbei und geh wann du magst.Idealerweise hast Du Dich über Meetup angemeldet und kommst genau in einer Sprechzeit - muß aber nicht sein. Bleib spontan. Was kann die Location? Das DWNTWN.cologne liegt am Rudolfplatz mitten im pulsierenden Herzen von Köln, im Belgischen Viertel, umschlungen von Cafes, Restaurants, Shops und dem liebenswerten Grüngürtel. Und ausserdem: SCHNELLES LAN + WLAN INKLUSIVEBUSINESS-DRUCKER + SCANNERKÜCHE + LOUNGE-BEREICH INKLUSIVESODASTREAM-WASSERFLAT INKLUSIVEMEETING-RAUMTELEFONIE-ZONE INKLUSIVEBAGUETTE RABATT IM KOELNKIOSK INKLUSIVE mehr zur Location: https://downtown.cologne/ Wie finanziert sich das? Wir haben 3 Tarife, um die Kosten zu decken und zugleich Diversität zu fördern. Sag einfach beim Ankommen Bescheid, welcher heute zu Dir passt. T1 für privates/ehrenamtliches/nicht-kommerzielles/studierendes Coworking mit 1 EUR / STUNDET2 für ein gemischtes Coworking mit 2 EUR / STUNDET3 für berufliches/kommerzielles/geldverdienendes Coworking mit 3 EUR / STUNDE Abgerechnet wird pro genutzter Stunde.\n",

Frente a otras metodologías ágiles, esta hace hincapié en buenas prácticas técnicas además de en la gestión de equipo y producto. Además de famosas prácitas como TDD o integración continua, XP tiene además varios principios que surgen de los valores sobre los que se asienta la metodología: comunicación, simplicidad, feedback, respeto y corage.

      " The 15th Hands-on Agile meetup continues exploring Liberating Structures for Scrum events. This time, we address the Daily Scrum. Liberating Structures cover a set of easy to learn, yet powerful ways to collaborate as a team—even as a large team—, overcoming traditional communications approaches like presentations, managed discussions, or another disorganized brainstorming at which the loudest participants tend to prevail. Throughout the coming months, we will create exciting new ways how to improve classic Scrum events like the Daily Scrum, the Sprint Review, ​or the Sprint Retrospective. Moreover, we will use Liberating Structures for difficult challenges that agile coaches, Scrum Masters, and Product Owners face, for example, reviewing the existing product design process. OUR HOST Our host is GameDuell GmbH. GameDuell is one of Europe's most experienced games studios with over 70 multiplayer titles under our belt and more than a decade of success in the online world: “We're a great team, working in a culture of fun, openness, and high performance.” Learn more about GameDuell GmbH on https://inside.gameduell.com/ and check out their Meetup​ page https://www.meetup.com/GameDuell-Meetups/ , too.

      " Image-rich websites and apps are great for monetization and content consumption. However, the user experience for people with visual impairments is far less pleasing to the eye, even to the point of inability to comprehend or to enjoy the content at all. Visual impairment can vary from different types of color blindness, getting colors mixed up, contrast sensitivity, not able to differentiate between colors, to user devices resolution and lighting. How do you, as frontend developers, handle images to offer good experience for these use cases while meeting the original functional requirements with minimal extra code and complexity? That's what this talk is about. ______________________________________ The speaker is Maya Shavin, a Senior Frontend Developer @Cloudinary and open source maintainer. In addition she is also a writer on Ultimate Courses and Frontend Weekly, where she mainly writes articles about JavaScript tutorials and good practices. She has been developing web apps with Angular, VueJS and recently ReactJS. She loves to learn and experiment with new framework, while believing that a strong Vanilla JavaScript knowledge is necessary for being a good web developer. When not coding, she enjoys traveling, reading manga, and sketching. _______________________________________ This taks is hosted at Adevinta office in Barcelona. We are a global digital player, the biggest marketplace specialist in Europe. But we are still a family of local brands – because we believe all great marketplaces are local. Our marketplaces serve people where they live, acknowledging what’s special about every culture and every place, helping local economies to grow sustainably.\n",

Sobre mí:Estudié fotografía artística en la escuela Serra i Abella (Hospitalet) y me gradué como psicóloga en la Universidad de Barcelona.Me dedico a enseñar fotografía, a adolescentes y adultos, intentando conectar esta disciplina con aspectos de la psicología que permitan a los participantes de mis clases poder trabajar sobre su propio autoconocimiento, reflexionar, motivarse y desarrollar una mirada diferente. Aquí puedes ver mis perfiles en las redes y conocer lo hago:https://www.facebook.com/julietadevotofotohttps://julietadevoto.carbonmade.comhttp://julietadevoto.blogspot.com/https://www.instagram.com/julietafotografiabcn/ Si alguno de vosotros casi no ha tocado la cámara y no sabe su funcionamiento, no hay problema, en esta clase empezaremos poco a poco. ¡Hasta pronto!\n",

      " Hi liebe Mitglieder, wie bereits angekündigt freuen wir uns auf unser 2. Meetup. Dieses Mal zum Thema Leadership. Wir werden eine Art Theater/Rollenspiel machen, um aufzuzeigen wie Leadership heute wahrgenommen wird und welche Fehler auch gemacht werden. Folgendes werden wir zusammen beleuchten bzw. so ist die grobe Agenda: Wir starten wie immer mit einem Warmup: Kennenlernen, wer ist da und ankommen und gehen dann fließend in die Agenda über. 1. Frage an Euch: Was versteht ihr unter Leadership und wie wendet ihr sie an? Welche guten und schlechten Beispiele für Leadership könnt ihr einbringen?2. Was bedeutet Leadership und was definitiv nicht?3. Was ist der Gedanke hinter dem Konzept und was sind die Ziele und was auch nicht.4. Wie wird man zum Leader und was muss ich dafür können oder tun?5. Worauf kommt es an wenn ihr als Team Leads, Projektmanager oder ähnliches Führen müsst. Egal ob disziplinarisch oder fachlich6. Q&A / Diskussion Hintergrund des Meetups ist, dass wir/ich immer wieder Fragen dazu bekomme und auch selbst erlebe wie viel man dabei falsch machen kann und wie effektiv es sein kann, wenn man ein paar Kleinigkeiten dabei beachtet. Leadership richtig eingesetzt verändert nicht nur wie wir Führen, sondern verändert die Kultur. Die Führungskultur als auch die Kultur wie wir miteinander umgehen und uns begegnen und wie wir anderen dabei helfen besser zu werden, beruflich wie privat also fachlich wie persönlich. Wir freuen uns sehr darauf mit euch in dieses spannende Thema einzutauchen. Food & Drinks: Pizza & Bier natürlich oder vielleicht was ganz anderes :-) VG euer Skimio Team p.s. Wenn 18:00 für einige zu früh ist. Wir können auch etwas nach Hinten verlegen, wenn nötig. Wollte es nur nicht zu späte machen. Bitte sagt mir einfach Bescheid. Vielen Dank :-)\n",

If you'd rather just talk, that's fine too. A language exchange for everyone! Same rules apply to games or conversation: 15 minutes English then we change to 15 minutes Spanish and all levels welcome!  It's a fun day out and there are always many native English speakers from all around the world (Australia, Canada, Ireland, America, England) and Spanish speakers from many countries also.

      " (En español, más abajo) We are going for a walk along the banks of the Genil. We will arrive by urban bus from Granada to Cenes, from where we will walk unhurriedly to Pinos Genil. When we arrive, we will simply greet the ducks that live there, in the river, and we will soon return to have a beer together (only humans, ducks, as everyone knows, they hate beer) It will be hot and there is no shade in all parts of the route, so do not forget to bring, at least, something like a hat, sunscreen, some water and clothing and shoes appropriate to the circumstances (no need to go armed because the ducks are harmless) The registration form will be opened approximately one week before the event. As always, it's absolutely free; iust talk and walk. Important! If you sign up but can not attend the meetup day, please cancel your registration so that the next one on the waiting list can participate. Leaving another person out for not doing just this, implies the termination of the subscription to the group. When you participate in a walk, you accept these rules: • We will make some photos of the group and we will share it on MeetUp.com if you do not want your image to be publicly shared here, please, do not subscribe. • This is a walk among friends and each one must take care of himself and his belongings (explanation -in Spanish- here: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51439874/#[masked]) • Guests can not be brought (explanation -in Spanish- here: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51419285) • Animals can not be brought: (explanation -in Spanish- here: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51419260) • You have to have the MeetUp app installed and if you can not come, you have to release your seat for the next one on the waiting list (explanation -in Spanish- here: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51232262) . Y ahora, en español. Vamos a dar un paseo por la ribera del Genil. Llegaremos en bus urbano de Granada hasta Cenes, desde donde caminaremos, sin prisas, hasta Pinos Genil. Al llegar, simplemente saludaremos a los patos que viven allí, en el río, y enseguida volveremos para tomarnos juntos una cerveza (solo los seres humanos, los patos, como todo el mundo sabe, odian la cerveza) Hará calor y no hay sombra en todas las partes del recorrido, así que no te olvides de llevar, al menos, algo como una gorra, protección solar, un poco de agua y ropa y calzado adecuados a las circunstancias (no es necesario ir armado porque los patos son inofensivos) El formulario de inscripción a este paseo se abrirá aproximadamente una semana antes del evento. Como siempre, es absolutamente gratis; sólo se trata de pasear juntos y charlar un rato. ¡Importante! Si te apuntas pero al final no puedes acudir al meetup, por favor, cancela tu inscripción para que pueda participar el siguiente de la lista de espera. Dejar fuera a otra persona por no hacer esto, implica el cese de la suscripción al grupo. Como en todos los meetups de Walking Granada, al participar en una salida, aceptas estas reglas: • Haremos fotos del grupo y las compartiremos aquí en MeetUp.com si no deseas que tu imagen sea compartida públicamente, no te apuntes. • Es una salida entre amigos, cada uno debe cuidar de sí y de sus pertenencias: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51439874/#[masked] • No traer invitados: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51419285 • No traer animales: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51419260 • Tener instalada la app de MeetUp y si no puedes acudir, tienes que liberar tu plaza para el siguiente de la lista de espera: https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/Walking-Granada/messages/boards/thread/51232262\n",

      " Serverless Computing oder auch Function as a Service (FaaS) bietet Entwicklern die Möglichkeit, einzelne Funktionen in der Cloud zur Verfügung zu stellen und über eine API anzusprechen. Der Cloud Provider abstrahiert dabei den Server und kümmert sich darum, den Funktionen eine eigene Laufzeitumgebung zu geben, sie jederzeit erreichbar zu machen und bei Bedarf zu skalieren. Somit kann der Entwickler sich voll auf seine Funktion konzentrieren. Obwohl diese Funktionen keinen Zustand haben, kann man mit ihnen sehr viele Anwendungsfälle schnell, einfach und zuverlässig lösen. Amazon Web Services (AWS) bietet mit AWS Lambda einen Service an, bei dem man diese Funktionen ausführen kann. Wir werden euch anhand einer kleinen Beispielanwendung zeigen, wie man diese Funktionen entwickelt und einsetzt. Im Anschluss freuen wir uns auf eine spannende Diskussion mit euch.

      " Non é doado pero estamos a tentar que cada ano nos visite un Java Champion. O ano pasado foi Simon Ritter, e este ano temos o honor de presentar a Heinz Kabutz, nas suas propias palabras: Heinz Kabutz is the author of The Java Specialists’Newsletter (https://www.javaspecialists.eu), a publication enjoyed by tens of thousands of Java experts in over 150 countries. His book “Dynamic Proxies (in German)” was #1 Bestseller on Amazon.de in Fachbücher für Informatik for about five minutes until Amazon fixed their algorithm. Thanks to a supportive mother, he has now sold 5 copies. Heinz’s Java Specialists’ newsletter is filled with amusing anecdotes of life on the Island of Crete. He is a popular speaker at all the best Java conferences around the world, and also at some of the worst. He teaches Java courses in classrooms around the world, where his prime objective is to make absolutely sure that none of his students fall asleep. He is not always successful. A Heinz tivemos a oportunidade de coñecelo o ano pasado e podemos asegurar que merece moito a pena! A sua charla: CompletableFutures are the rage today. We use them to describe complicated concurrent workflows. For example, HttpClient in Java 11 returns them when we send asynchronous requests. They can also describe parallel divide and conquer workflows. In this talk, we will start by parallelizing a large Fibonacci calculation with Fork/Join. We will then change java.math.BigInteger to multiply in parallel. You will learn how to patch with the new modules system. Then we will show the issues with Fork/Join and show a solution based on CompletableFuture. O meetup farase no Centro Ágora, aula 9 (graciñas a CoruñaDixital pola colaboración) as 19:00 o martes 9 de Xullo. O rexistro faise a través da páxina do Meetup. A duración estimada será de 90 minutos. Tamén queremos agradecer os amigos de ZaraTech por traerse a Heinz ata Coruña e prestarse a que faga esta charla en aberto. O rematar, e como marca a tradición, iremos tomar uns refrescos patrocinados por CoruNet (graciñas!!) no bar do lado para charlar un rato e relaxarnos un pouco. Non todos os días un ten a oportunidade unha birra cun Java Champion, e moito menos con un tan humilde e divertido coma Heinz, así que non vos perdades este meetup!!\n",

      " ¡Hola Filomeetuperos! Si lo pensáis un instante, uno de los temas que podríamos decir común a los seres humanos es éste: Todos tenemos problemas. Grandes, pequeños medianos, imposibles, superfluos… sí, pero problemas al fin y al cabo. En ocasiones, vivimos tan absorbidos por el problemas más cercano y presente que perdemos la objetividad (porque es MI problema), o la perspectiva (porque es el que tengo delante). ¿Podríamos cambiar nuestra actitud ante cada problema? ¿Existen quizá otras soluciones alternativas a la que estemos usando? El próximo sábado 20 de julio a las 18h. vamos a remangarnos y enfrentar las dificultades filosóficamente. Si hace buen tiempo, este meetup tendrá lugar en el parque de Santa Margarita (zona de las mesas próximas al quiosco). Si en cambio llueve, lo organizaremos en el local de La Escuela Iniciativas Culturales (Calle Aaiún, 4 bajo. A Coruña). Podeis traer algo de picar para compartir :) ¡Nos vemos muy pronto!

      " Venez travailler de manière collaborative et résolvons ensemble un challenge. Au cours de ce meetup de 3h, nous transmettrons les bases du Design Thinking de manière active et collaborative en l'appliquant à un cas. Nous passerons par les différentes étapes du processus et passerons ensemble de l'idée à l'action. 👊 Découvrez des exemples de challenges que nous avons résolus : www.klap.io/use-case ................................................................ L'innovation n'est plus seulement liée aux nouveautés technologiques mais repose de plus en plus sur la capacité à maîtriser / ré-inventer la collaboration, la discussion et la co-création en équipe. Le Design Thinking est une approche de l'innovation et de son management basé sur une combinaison entre Design et Business. Il s'appuie sur un processus de co-créativité mettant au coeur de la démarche l'utilisateur final. Tim Brown, référence dans le domaine et fondateur de l'agence IDEO, définit le Design Thinking en 3 grandes parties : Inspiration, Imagination, Implémentation. Grâce à ce parcours, l'équipe est capable d'apprendre de ses utilisateurs, découvrir de nouvelles opportunités, valider de potentielles solutions, résoudre des problèmes, rencontrer des besoins non identifiés et tester des hypothèses.\n",

      " DESIGN THINKING METHOD JAM Wir alle arbeiten gern mit Design Thinking Methoden, die wir gut kennen und schon oft gemacht haben. Oder wir wandeln Methoden um oder ab, weil sie so besser oder für einen anderen Zweck funktionieren. Bei diesem Meet-Up geht es darum, über den eigenen Methoden-Tellerrand zu schauen und neue Methoden kennenzulernen und auszuprobieren.Der Method Jam ist ein bewährtes Format an der HPI School of Design Thinking, um den Methodenaustausch und Weiterentwicklung unter den Coaches zu institutionalisieren und voneinander zu lernen. Außerdem bietet er die Möglichkeit, neue Methoden risikofrei und mit viel Spaß auszuprobieren und Feedback zu sammeln. Alle Teilnehmer*innen werden gebeten eine Methode mitzubringen/vorzubereiten, die sie in 30 Minuten mit einem Team von 5-7 Personen vorstellen, ausprobieren und reflektieren können.Jede*r Teilnehmer*in hat die Möglichkeit, seine/ihre Methode zu Beginn in einer Minute vorzustellen. Danach wählen die Teilnehmer*innen aus, welche 4-5 Methoden dann in Kleingruppen ausprobiert werden sollen. In einer zweiten Runde werden weitere Methoden ausprobiert, so dass auch die Moderator*innen der ersten Runde Gelegenheit haben, eine neue Methode zu erlernen. Im Anschluss werden im Plenum alle Methoden kurz präsentiert und reflektiert. Dieses Meet-Up benötigt etwas Vorbereitung. Bitte bringt eine Methode mit und macht Euch vorab Gedanken über folgende Fragen: - Titel der Methode- Ziel und Zielgruppe- Wo im DT-Prozess wird sie angewendet? (Warm-Up, Ideation, Transfer, etc.)- Kurze Skizze wie es funktioniert- AHA-Moment/ warum ist sie so toll? Wichtig ist es, die Methode nicht nur vorzustellen, sondern sie gemeinsam mit den anderen Teilnehmer*innen auszuprobieren. Post-Its, Papier und Stifte stellen wir zur Verfügung, anderes Material und Templates bitte mitbringen falls notwendig. AGENDA: 18:30: Ankommen & Kennenlernen, Methoden-Pitch vorbereiten19:00: Methoden-Pitches & Voting (1min/ Methode)19:45: Method Jamming (2 Runden à 4-5 Methoden in Kleingruppen parallel)21:00: Method Gallery (Vorstellung aller Methoden im Plenum)21:30: Ende Wir freuen uns riesig, Jule Schröder als Co-Organisatorin bei diesem Meetup dabei zu haben! Jule Schröder hat 2013/14 den Basic und Advanced Track an der HPI School of Design Thinking in Potsdam absolviert und im Anschluss als Innovations- und Design Thinking Coach bei Kill Your Darling und and der HPI Academy GmbH in unzähligen Workshops Design Thinking als Methode unterrichtet sowie Innovationsprozesse moderiert und begleitet.

You will find us at the back room of the Bar or outside in the back. If there is any questions on the location, you can post it in the group or ask the bartenders at the bar. Beginners and experienced gamers are welcome, but this is a bar, with smaller tables, so shorter, lighter games are probably better than 6 hour epics :) The bar games library will grow over time, so for now bring a few games with you that you'd like to play.

      " La propuesta es pasar una noche de verano totalmente original e inolvidable. Iremos al santuario de Torrelles de Foix (con servicios etc.. y en exclusiva) situado cerca de Barcelona, pero con una calidad de cielo envidiable, combinado con una luna nueva nos permitirá, bajo un cielo estrellado, ver incluso la vía láctea a simple vista. Haremos una ruta circular de trekking suave. A la llegada un guia nos enseñara el santuario de la Mare de Deu de Foix y cenaremos al exterior en un lugar privilegiado del santuario (incluido). La cena consistirá en un pica-pica de croquetas, empanadas, embutidos ibéricos, quesos, pan con tomate y aceite, patatas, olivas...bebidas frescas y para acabar cocas y cava del Penedès. Las Perseidas son una de las mejores lluvias de meteoros que se pueden observar, produciendo hasta 60 meteoros por hora en su punto máximo. Es producido por el cometa Swift-Tuttle, que fue descubierto en 1862. Las Perseidas son famosas por producir una gran cantidad de meteoros brillantes. La lluvia ocurre anualmente desde el 17 de julio hasta el 24 de agosto. Su punto máximo llega este año la noche del 12 de agosto, pero en esas fechas la luna estará un 96% llena, por lo que imposibilitara una visión clara de la mayoría de los meteoros. Por eso este año haremos las Perseidas la noche del 1 de agosto, cuando habrá luna nueva (100%). Tendremos una noche muy oscura por lo que aunque en teoria, su número es algo menor, por contra seran mucho más visibles. Además para la astronomia sera una noche ideal. Sera una noche mágica de astronomia, asesorados en todo momento por nuestro astrónomo particular el Victor. Haremos 3 actividades de astronomía. 1.- Identificación de estrellas y constelaciones de verano. Con un potente láser verde, Victor nos enseñara paso a paso a reconocer las diferentes constelaciones y estrellas.2.- En un lugar privilegiado, arriba en el Santuario, nos tumbaremos en el suelo y nos pondremos a contar Perseidas.3.- En paralelo a las Perseidas, Victor habrá instalado un potente telescopio; por lo que cuando queramos podremos ir a ver en tiempo real, con una cámara CCD astronómica especial, Júpiter, Saturno, Cúmulos globulares, Nebulosas y Galaxias. Nos llevaremos de recuerdo archivos de las imágenes de estos objetos. Para quienes tengáis interés Victor explicara el funcionamiento y puesta en marcha de un equipo astronómico. Que HAREMOS?✔︎ Nos encontraremos en Torrelles de Foix (Alt Penedés), organizaremos transporte desde Barcelona, desde allí en 10’ llegaremos en coche hasta el santuario, dejaremos los coches en el parking de tierra.✔︎ Haremos una ruta circular de 5 km y 277 m de desnivel, siguiendo pistas forestales y senderos.✔︎ Haremos una visita guiada al santuario y cenaremos.✔︎ Sobre las 10 de la noche bajaremos al parking del santuario y nos enseñaran a reconocer estrellas y constelaciones.✔︎ Nos pondremos en las zonas altas del santuario y mirando con preferencia hacia el N-NE, haremos un concurso para ver quien consigue ver más Perseidas.✔︎ En paralelo haremos una actividad con telescopio. Si la previsión del tiempo, 3 días antes, son malas se cancelará la salida. -TRANSPORTE-Se organizarán coches con anterioridad a la salida. El coste del transporte es de 5€ por persona que se le paga directamente al conductor. *El conductor tiene un descuento de 3 € por cada persona que lleve en el coche. Por contra solo podrá tomar una copa de cava. -PRECIO-Precio de la actividad: 35 €. Hay que llevar:✔︎Ropa cómoda (mejor por capas), aun que sea agosto puede refrescar. Nota: Si no tienes transporte. Tu plaza no está asegurada hasta que te confirme el organizador. *Al inscribirte deja teléfono de contacto y si vienes con coche, para que nos podamos organizar. Incluido:✔︎ Guía en ruta✔︎ Visita guiada al santuario y uso en exclusiva.✔︎ Cena✔︎ Actividades astronómicas✔︎ Seguro e Impuestos ** Fotos originales del equipo de astronomía. + INFO[masked] Víctor\n",

      " Dear Deeplearners, The Deep Learning meetup is coming back on 18/07, again at Samsung Paris office. You must be registered on the EventBrite event to be accepted for security reason (https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/deep-learning-meetup-17-at-samsung-paris-tickets-64993557480). Bring your ID as it will be checked beforehand. We'll have 3 great speakers: Damien MENIGAUX (Veesion): Veesion is relies on video deep learning to detect theft related gestures in real time in retail stores. Since its inception in 2014, video deep learning has made some important strives. The appearance of large scale video datasets was accompanied by important architectural findings. If traditionnal image deep learning is considered by some as a \"solved problem\", the temporal dimension in videos still isn't well understood. Let's take a look back at the most ingenious and successful innovations in video deep learning networks. Eloi Zablocki (LIP6 Sorbonne Université): As textual resources are abundant and contain high-level knowledge, linguistic representations can be used to augment capacities of computer vision recognition systems, typically when visual supervision is scarce. We thus focus on the zero-shot learning recognition task which consists in recognizing objects that have never been seen, thanks to linguistic knowledge acquired about the objects beforehand. We present a model for zero-shot recognition that leverages (1) the region of interest, (2) the semantic representations of object labels, and (3) the visual context of an object Thibaut Barroyer (Cardiologs): Cardiologs is a medical technology company committed to transforming cardiac diagnostics by utilising medical-grade deep learning techniques. Developing deep learning models to solve medical problems is challenging: FDA clearance, data annotation, clinical expertise in the team… We will give an overview of the two main algorithms that our solution is built upon: networks for classification (diagnosis) and segmentation (waves identification) of electrocardiograms (ECG). We will then present an application to the detection of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, responsible of sudden cardiac arrest, and present results of a comparative study we ran with physicians.

      " Rejoignez-nous pour notre prochain meetup chez Liferay qui nous accueillera pour cette soirée. Merci à eux ! Talk 1 : Bonita et Elasticsearch - pour une automatisation intelligente : une meilleure information conduit à de meilleures décisions Lorsqu’il s’agit de développer un modèle de predictive process mining, s’appuyer directement sur des données stockées dans une base de données relationnelle n’est surement pas la meilleure approche. Cette présentation aura pour but de partager le retour d’expérience de Bonitasoft, éditeur d’une solution open source de Business Process Automation, dans l’utilisation d’Elasticsearch pour développer un modèle ayant pour objectif la prédiction du temps d’exécution de processus métiers (workflow). Par Antoine Mottier, Technical Evangelist @ Bonitasoft.Antoine a été tour à tour développeur, consultant, formateur et évangéliste technique. Le lien entre toutes ces fonctions réside dans une passion pour les différentes technologies mises en œuvre au service des utilisateurs. En tant qu'évangéliste technique il a à cœur de partager son expertise technique aussi bien sur la solution Bonita que sur les différentes technologies sur lesquelles Bonita s'appuie ou s’intègre. Le partage des connaissances se fait entre autre via l'animation de la communauté open source, des webinars, la partition à différentes conférences et la publication d'un livre introduisant les notions de Business Process Management. Talk 2 : Liferay, Search & Customization Elasticsearch est le moteur de recherche par défaut dans Liferay depuis la version 7.0 sortie en 2016. Auparavant, Liferay utilisait Solr un moteur aussi basé sur Lucene et qui est toujours compatible avec Liferay. Dans cette présentation, nous allons voir comment Liferay est construit afin d’être “agnostique” de la solution de recherche, et comment Elasticsearch est utilisé au sein de cette DXP. Nous allons également voir comment il est possible de construire sa propre application de recherche dans Liferay au travers d’un exemple open-source “Liferay GSearch” qui permet d’avoir une expérience de recherche “à la Google”. Par Louis-Guillaume Durand, Pre-Sales Consultant, Liferay Louis-Guillaume a développé son expertise Liferay depuis 2012 sur de nombreux projets. Depuis 2018, il a rejoint les équipes de Liferay en tant que Pre-Sales Consultant afin d’accompagner les clients et partenaires Liferay sur l'architecture, l'implémentation et le développement des solutions Liferay.

      " Ubiqum is thrilled to announce a special event taking place on Tuesday 16 July across our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam. We will interview three members of the IBM Watson Discovery News team, a cutting edge project applying Watson’s AI engine and advanced data science techniques to reimagine how news is conveyed. Jenny Woo (shown above) and John Carpenter (check out his Instagram it’s seriously cool: instagram.com/johnbcarpenter/) are the lead visualization experts on the team and Tom Wall is the Sr. Software Engineer, so you will have the opportunity to learn both about the front- and back-end aspects of how Watson Discovery News was built. Following the event please stick around to discuss what we learned and network with Ubiqum’s students, alumni and friends in each city._______________________________________ AGENDA 17:30 - open doors: meet & greet with food & drinks17:45 - introduction18:00 - live AMA with IBM Watson19:30 - debate & controversy, networking & fraternising20:30 - goodbye _______________________________________ ABOUT IBM WATSON IBM Watson is one of the world’s most powerful Artificial Intelligence machines. It famously utilized breakthrough research in Natural Language Processing to defeat the greatest Jeopardy champions. To learn more about the Discovery News project with Watson, we strongly encourage you to check out Jenny Woo’s recent article on Medium: Visualizing the News with Watson Discovery (https://medium.com/design-ibm/visualizing-the-news-with-watson-discovery-13e8be538428)._______________________________________ WHAT IS AN “AMA”? The “Ask-Me-Anything” format is an opportunity for you, the participants, to pose your own questions to experts. We will solicit questions from the community in advance and then use them to drive the discussion. Nathan Benjamin, Ubiqum’s Head of Product, will facilitate the discussion with Guillem Perdigo, Sr. Data Mentor in Berlin. The IBM Watson team will join the discussion from their offices in New York. The event will be broadcast live in our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam for live attendees, and streamed on Ubiqum’s Facebook and LinkedIn pages. Capacity is limited at some of our locations, so we cannot guarantee you a spot but will let you know ahead of time if the event is full, and of course, we encourage anyone unable to attend to join us via the live stream. We look forward to seeing you on July 16th!\n",

      " *** REGISTRATION THROUGH EVENTBRITE: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-successful-product-decisions-w-marley-spoon-n26-tickets-64981880554?aff=Meetup *** You don't solve a problem with an answer, you solve a problem with a question! And that's what startups do continuously: solve product problems. We have two amazing people joining us at The Family to share their expertise around product: 🔥 Charles Vestal, Head of Digital Product Management at Marley Spoon🔥 Omkar Pimple, Senior Android Engineer at N26 // LINE UP ➡️ ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS: APPROACHES TO IDENTIFY AND MEASURE THE SUCCESS OF PRODUCT DECISIONS, Charles Vestal, Head of Digital Product Management at Marley Spoon „You don't solve a problem with an answer, you solve a problem with a question“. Startups need to continuously solve product problems. This may ultimately help transform them from a small business into a global company. It's import to have techniques to understand what problems to solve and how to go about it while keeping in mind that your customers ultimately don't care about what you do, but care about what you do for them. Through a discussion on the processes of a data-driven product department at Marley Spoon, this talk will showcase how to analyze problems, the best ways to measure the success of your solutions, and how failure can develop into product insights and customer successes.💪 Charles’ multi-faceted career path has taken him through a broad swath of the digital world. His passion for technology paired with his customer-oriented mindset have taken his professional journey from his beginnings as a web consultant to a digital producer building products for Disney, Paramount Pictures, FOX Networks, and Google, among others. After launching dozens of products for clients, his deep-dive into product leadership began as Director of Product for adtech startup ThoughtLeadr, before becoming Head of Production at Uncorked Studios, a product design agency based in Portland focused on the intersection of digital and physical. Today, he oversees the Digital Product Management Department at Marley Spoon, where he keeps pursuing his ultimate goal to keep building value for businesses and their users.🚀 ➡️ RELEASING MOBILE APPS RELIABLY, CONSISTENTLY AND QUICKLY AT SCALE, Omkar Pimple, Senior Android Engineer at N26 This talk sheds some light on how mobile app release management evolved at N26, the hidden complexity and dependencies among stakeholders for each release, and the process we engineered to tackle this complexity as the company underwent hypergrowth. Omkar is a software engineer currently working at N26 GmbH, where he focuses on building mobile architecture, design systems, engineering processes and teams that perform at scale. He also works on his own Android pet projects that have reached over 5 million users across 180+ countries. 🙌 --- The event is 100% open and free! 😉 It will be followed by a Q&A to satisfy your curiosity as well as some time to get to know each other over cookies and drinks 🍪🍷 Don't forget to register to let us know you're coming 😉:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/making-successful-product-decisions-w-marley-spoon-n26-tickets-64981880554?aff=Meetup ------------------------------------- The Family nurtures ambitious startups in Europe.

      " Liebe Weinfreunde, bei der ersten Weinprobe im Geschwister Café kam ein Riesling auf den ersten Platz des Blindtastings! Nun wollen wir uns intensiver mit der weltweit geschätzten deutschen Rebsorte beschäftigen. Eine kleine Neuerung: Damit wir das Event noch besser planen können, möchten wir euch bitten, per Vorkasse zu bezahlen, möglichst bis zum 13. Juli. Details dazu weiter unten. Zur Weinprobe selbst: Sechs spannende Rieslinge wollen verkostet werden – und die schmecken keineswegs alle gleich! Unterschiede gibt es zum Beispiel beim Alter, Preis, Ausbau und Anbaugebiet der Weine, und das manifestiert sich im Geschmack. Die Kenner unter euch können vielleicht einige der Weine unterscheiden. Mitraten, welcher Wein gerade getrunken wird, darf natürlich jeder. Denn es handelt sich wie immer um eine Blindprobe. Ich verrate erst am Ende, wann welcher Wein im Glas war. Auch Wein-Neulinge sind willkommen! Nach dem Erschnuppern und Erschmecken folgt die Bewertung auf einer Skala von 1 bis 10. Am Ende wird der Schleier gelüftet und ich erzähle etwas zu den Weinen. Zwischendrin gibt es ein kleines Pub-Quiz. Aber keine Bange: Man muss nicht mitmachen. Dann kann man allerdings auch keinen Preis gewinnen! ;) Zu den 6 Weißweinen der Probe tischt uns Gastgeberin Katrin leckeren Käse & Co. auf. Kosten und Bezahlung: 27 Euro pro Person. Am einfachsten bezahlt ihr per Paypal an [masked] oder ihr geht beim Café vorbei und zahlt dort. Alternativ geht auch eine Überweisung: Schickt mir eine Nachricht und ich sende euch die Kontodaten vom Geschwister Café. Bitte zahlt im Voraus, am besten bis zum 13. Juli, damit wir den Abend besser planen können. Teilnehmerzahl: 30 (plus ein paar von Katrins Stammgästen) Ich freue mich auf einen lustigen Abend,Jan\n",

      " The summer is perfect to take a break, relax and come back refilled with energy. It’s also a good time to reflect and see what we’d like to change in ourselves, in our role or in our organisation. That’s why for our summer special hosted at HomeToGo, we’d like to invite you to join us to talk about the changes that are needed to build better products. Indeed, we all want to build great products that customers love, yet sometimes this requires change. We speak more and more about being data-informed, being experimentation-driven, doing more discovery work, but for these to happen, the right company culture has to be established. But it’s not all it takes, product people need to know how to drive changes in organisations too when needed. On that note, we’re happy to announce two speakers: Dominik Zins, VP of Product at HomeToGo Product discovery in startups: How to nurture a discovery culture into a growing organisationAnd as a summer special: How to find your ideal vacation rental in August, when everything seems to be booked out? Shaun Russell, Product Coach Uncomfortable Creatures: Make Great Products by Mastering Conflict & CommunicationShaun will explain how effective conflict and communication are fundamental to Product Management, and how we can use them to change the organisation around us, and build better products. 6:30 PM - Doors open, food and drinks! (please arrive before 7.30pm)7:30 PM - Hello from Product Tank7:45 PM - Dominik Zins8:15 PM - Shaun Russell8:45 PM - Q&A9:15 PM - Networking & drinks More info about our speakers: - Dominik Zinshttps://www.linkedin.com/in/dominik-zins-7ab74820/Dominik, a true Berliner, joined HomeToGo in May 2018.He is an enthusiastic product leader who actively engages both customers and the Product Management team into his work.

His central belief is that almost all work in Product boils down to communication and conflict. By honing these core skills, you can radically change your impact as a Product Manager.Previously he played a central role in the overhaul of Product at Outfittery, leading projects to redefine product strategy and team structure.

      " Un de los puntos importantes, pero muy importante en la cultura de un hacker es entender los \"entresijos\" de la programación. En HackMadrid vamos a organizar una \"saga\" sobre programación, desde el punto de vista de un hacker, que no es necesariamente idéntico al de un programador profesional. Comenzamos este ciclo con un gran amigo de HackMadrid, me refiero a Ulises Gascón, programador e instructor de programación, co-fundador de Open Source Weekend y con una muy amplía experiencia y profundos conocimientos de programación y tecnologías del software libre. En esta ocasión, Ulises comenzará con una charla sobre Nodejs 4 Hackers, esta charla continúa con un taller previsto para el Sábado 27 de 10:00 -> 14:00 horas en La Nave de Madrid, el cual anunciaremos en breve. ### Descripción ###Una charla que vendrá acompañada de un taller posterior (que anunciaremos proximamente) para entender como podemos utilizar todo el potencial de Nodejs (Asincronía, Streams, librerías...) para automatizar procesos y generar herramientas (CLI, Aplicaciones de escritorio, servicios web, criptografía, etc...) que nos ayuden con nuestras tareas en el mundo de la ciberseguridad Nivel: Básico-Intermedio Requisitos previos: No es necesario instalar nada, pero se recomienda repasar las bases de JavaScript con este vídeo:https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg ### Bio ###Ulises es Fullstack Open Source Developer. Fundador de Open Source Weekends (OSW). Profesor en Fictizia. Maintainer de Yeoman y otros proyectos Open Source. xGoogler y xIBMer. En breve anunciaremos el espacio donde se dará la charla. ¡¡ Los esperamos !!\n",

Pueden ver cómo se va desplegando el árbol San Saru (https://san-saru-spain.herokuapp.com/graph/index)* Seguimos haciendo meetups de difusión del evento: el último fue “¿Cómo ser más creativos?” en Agile Barcelona y próximamente será “¿Por qué fallan las iniciativas de cambio?” en Madrid ágil.* Seguimos en busca de Osos Pardos y Linces Ibéricos que apoyen este evento, aquí el dossier de patrocinadores (http://spain.agileopen.camp/docs/Patrocinios_Agile_Open_Camp_Spain2019.pdf) Agenda del 11 de julio-------------------------------------------------Check-in de los asistentesSincronización de las tribus Difusión y comunicación, Lugar y transporte, Finanzas y sponsors y Inscripciones y participantes1. ¿Qué avances ha logrado la tribu desde el 7 de mayo?2. ¿Cuáles van a ser sus próximos pasos (3 semanas)?3. ¿Qué pedidos u ofertas involucrando otras tribus tienen?4. ¿Qué agradecimientos quieren expresar?Lanzamiento de nueva tribu: Programa del Agile Open CampCheck-out de los asistentes ¿Qué es el Agile Open Camp?-------------------------------------------------El Agile Open Camp (AOC) es un evento comunitario colaborativo, auto-organizado y sin fines de lucro.

New events with Arthur Brock (founder Holochain) and Eric Bear (Holo):https://www.meetup.com/holochain-barcelona/events/262779581/https://www.meetup.com/holochain-barcelona/events/262780555/ --- During this evening we are having a round table discussion about the different apps that are being created by Holo. We will learn more about these apps and how we can use them as building blocks for our own projects. As always, there will be plenty of room and time for questions and discussion. Arthur Brock wrote:\"With the release of Holo’s Closed Alpha test network, I thought this would be a good time to share about the apps available for hosting on Holo. While there’s not a huge ecosystem yet, the apps we’re releasing are kind of a big deal, both for their individual capabilities and for their usefulness as building blocks for further app development.\" resource: https://medium.com/h-o-l-o/a-tour-of-holos-initial-apps-45b00f7e9054 This evening is also interesting for newcomers to Holo and Holochain and none techies.

      " Herzliche Einladung zur zweiten Ausgabe von Spekulative Futures: Stuttgart in der BAR RAKETE im Theater Rampe Veronica RannerPolyphonic Futuring and Design-Science — Speculative Design revisited Von \"Wearable Technology\" zu \"Implantable Technology\" — in diesem Vortrag wird die Künstlerin und Designerin Veronica Ranner das aufkeimende Feld der \"Bio-Digitalität\" vorstellen. Die hier verwendeten, neuartigen Biomaterialien, sogenannte \"Smart Materials\", ermöglichen neue Schnittstellen und Interaktionen zwischen Körpern und Computern. Ranner erforscht seit 2009 «Reverse Engineered Silk» — eine neuartige verflüssigte Seide, die vom menschlichen Gewebe vollständig und ohne Abstossungsreaktionen akzeptiert und abgebaut werden kann. Diese Seide erlaubt es, den Körper und seine Gewebe als «programmierbare Plattform» zu verstehen, die die Visualisierung bislang unsichtbarer Körperprozesse ermöglicht. Hierdurch entsteht das für DesignerInnen neue Feld der «Body Interfaces», das als Fortsetzung der bestehenden «Wearable Electronics» zu verstehen ist. Dieses eröffne nicht nur neue Potentiale, sondern stelle DesignerInnen vor komplexe Fragen, die sich weit über das Objektdesign hinaus erstrecken. Ranner's Vortrag stellt anhand von Beispielen ihre neu entwickelte Design-Methodik vor, \"Polyphonic Futuring\", das auf den Prinzipien des Critical-Speculative Designs und Partizipation Designs aufbaut. Diese Methode ermöglicht es die medizinischen, ethischen, praktischen und kritischen Dimensionen von Bio-Digitalität umfänglich zu beleuchten, demokratisch zu verhandeln um somit langfristige gesellschaftlich-relevante Zukünfte zu erwirken. Zusammenfassend wird die Rolle des Designschaffenden als MediatorIn vorgestellt welche aktives, systemisches und konstruktives Zukunftsgestalten befördert. ————————————————— Veronica Ranner's Arbeiten behandeln die experimentelle Schnittstelle zwischen Design, Wissenschaft und Kunst. Nach dem Studium des Industriedesigns an der Hochschule Pforzheim und einem Master in Design Interactions am Royal College of Art in London, arbeitete sie transdisziplinär mit verschiedenen wissenschaftlichen und biomedizinischen Unternehmen zusammen. In ihrer Praxis entwickelt sie spekulative Szenarien und experimentelle Methoden für konstruktives, kollektives Entwerfen von Zukünften. Derzeit promoviert sie mit ihrer Dissertation zum Thema «Bio-Digitalität» am Royal College of Art in London und ist Gastwissenschaftlerin am SilkLab der Tufts University in Boston. Ranner lehrt weltweit und ihre Arbeiten werden regelmässig international ausgetellt, u.a. im Israel Museum in Jerusalem, in der Science Gallery in Dublin, im China Technology Museum in Beijing, im Salone del Mobile in Mailand, der French Design Biennale in St. Etienne, dem Nationalmuseum in Stockholm, dem V&A Museum in London, dem Marta Herford Museum, dem Design Museum Gent und dem Futurium in Berlin. Veronica Ranner ist Gründerin von «Polyphonic Futures» (2014), einer designwissenschaftlichen Plattform, die Gestaltung und Wissenschaft sowie deren Akteure miteinander verbindet. www.veronicaranner.comwww.polyphonicfutures.com ————————————————— Da wir einen internationalen Gast und damit höhere Auslagen haben, bitten wir dieses Mal um 3 € Eintritt, dieser wird in bar an der Abendkasse fällig. Gastgeber: Prof. Julia Kühne, Prof. Benedikt Groß, Dr. Eileen Mandir. Speculative Futures: Stuttgart wird fotografisch dokumentiert.

      " Please keep your RSVP up to date, free spots are always in demand! We will meet at 6.30pm at Rohde & Schwarz Technology Center with pizza and drinks. The talk starts at 7pm and will be in English. Dr. Baris Guezelarslan: DDD - Lessons Learned After the talk we have time for drinks and conversations. Abstract:This talk describes the speaker's path from a monolith towards a service-based application. It is a potpourri of all the light bulb moments on this journey including actor models, event sourcing, CQRS, functional programming, polyglot persistence, and workflow engines. This talk will cover the problem domain, which is an enterprise application processing data streams from different sensors (IoTs), without going into too much detail. Due to performance issues, the content will be based on event sourcing and CQRS which is often considered too complex (for no reason). It will be shown that the basic idea and the implementation can be very simple. The split of the write and the read model will also help to separate behavior from data. The main focus will not be based on technical implementations, but on how to change your mindset to solve your problem. Bio:Baris is currently working in the Innovation Lab at Rohde & Schwarz. Previously, he was responsible for a high-throughput backend. He is a DDD thinker and tinker. He still feels like an apprentice on DDD and continues to learn more on this topic. Accordingly, he is looking forward to discuss his experiences with you in order to get constructive feedback. Location:Entrance is at the gate of Rohde & Schwarz at Mühldorfstr. 15 (at the pedestrian crossing). From there we will bring you to the Rohde & Schwarz Technology Center.\n",

Ese trabajo está destinado a buscar el equilibrio personal, en primer lugar, y luego a compartirlo con los demás y con la Tierra, para ayudar entre todos a plantar semillas de conciencia. Las convocamos en esta fase lunar porque la luna llena amplifica todo lo que se hace durante los días en que tiene lugar. Amplificamos así el efecto de la meditación, que ya de por sí es muy potente, debido a la reunión de tantas personas colaborando desde el corazón. Facilitadora: Mónica Larruy.

Der Raum ist bereits 15 Minuten vor Gruppenbeginn geöffnet und du kannst die Zeit nutzen, um mit den anderen Teilnehmern in Kontakt zu treten. Im Mutup zu mehr Selbstliebe kannst du mehr Mut finden, du selbst zu sein und dich selbst mehr zu lieben. Ganz echt und ehrlich. Du lernst, Liebe aktiv zu erschaffen und zu schenken. Mit Liebe deine größte Sehnsucht zu erfüllen – von Beziehung bis Berufung. Anders als bei der Anfängergruppe gehen wir hier darauf ein, was andere von sich teilen. Wir zeigen, wie wir uns damit fühlen. So erfahren wir, wie liebevoll andere uns wirklich empfinden, und wo unsere Liebe vielleicht noch wachsen kann. Dabei legen wir ein besonderes Augenmerk auf Ehrlichkeit - dir selbst und anderen gegenüber.Wir geben und erhalten unschätzbares Feedback, das wir so offen und aufrichtig nur äußerst selten geschenkt bekommen. Es ist unverzichtbar (!), um die Kunst des Liebens zu meistern. Im Zentrum des Abends steht das Prinzip: Liebe ist eine Tätigkeit.Das Mutup zu mehr Selbstliebe findet jeden 2. und 4. Mittwoch im Monat statt. Die Teilnahme ist kostenlos, aber wir freuen uns über eine kleine Spende für die Raumkosten und als Energieausgleich. Wir freuen uns auf dich!\n",

      " Hey Founders Fighters and Friends! Unsere gemeinsame Event-Serie mit der VHV geht in die nächste Runde. Am[masked] treffen wir uns zum nächsten spannenden Austausch und Networking. Dieses Mal geht es um das Thema \"Future of Work\" - wieso braucht's denn eine Zukunft der Arbeit, wenn ab übermorgen doch sowieso schon Roboter die Arbeit verrichten? Worin bleibt der Mensch als kreatives Team-Mitglied unschlagbar? Agilität, Lean und Design Thinking werden als beschreibende Schlagwörter durch die Büros geworfen, aber warum macht es überhaupt Sinn, sich damit zu beschäftigen? Wenn Du noch nicht die Zeit bis zur Rente absitzt, in deinem Job Wirkung erzielen willst und dich nicht von Mittagspause bis Mittagspause hangeln magst. Wenn du ein stärkeres Team aufbauen willst und von anderen Best Practice erfahren willst. Wenn dich interessiert, warum es eigentlich Digitale Labs und bunte Post-It Notes gibt.

      " +++ Where we are going to meet +++Oberursel (Taunus)-Hohemark +++ Train +++U3 going North-West from Hauptwache +++ Tickets +++--- to be updated --- +++ Motivation +++An early morning hike around Gr Feldberg to Oberems. The trek will pass Altkönig, Kl Feldberg, Glaskopf until we reach Gr Feldberg. I have never taken this route before; so expect dangers like muddy tracks, fallen trees in our path and the occasional mountain biker group racing through the forest. +++ Notes +++1, You will have issues with mobile phones. Your GPS may not be accurate. Unless you've been to this area it's easy to be lost, thankfully there are many villages nearby and busy roads. 2, I will not be booking a restaurant, so please pack sufficient food and drink for the day. If we spot an appropriate restaurant/bar on the route (Fuchstanz or Gasthaus zum Roten Kreuz) we will vote to take a break. 3, Any body who departs from the group is responsible for their own safety and return. 4, There is a bus at the end, to return us to Hohemark Oberursel Bahn. See photo in description with price. 5, Please wear hiking shoes/boots, enough water for yourself (1,5L is recommended), some food/snacks and a mattress/blanket for the break. 6, If you have questions about the weather or location, try Google!\n",

      " Dear all, Milan is getting hotter but a new event from ML Milan is going to come to refresh your minds before the vacation break. It will take place in the beautiful location of Google Milan office and this time we will have two talks from Riccardo Lorenzon and Andrea Marisio. “Use survival analysis to estimate spare parts market potential”During the speech Riccardo will go through challenges and opportunities of using customer service data to run survival analysis on product components and subsequently estimate the market potential for spare parts. Seasonality, censored data, partial observation windows and mixture of distributions are only a few of the technical issues that have to be tackled. The purpose of the talk is to propose a possible approach and brainstorm over potential other solutions. Riccardo LorenzonRiccardo is Lead Data Scientist in Whirlpool EMEA, previously Senior Data Scientist in Data Reply. He holds a Master of Science at Politecnico of Milano in Mathematical Engineering with a focus on Mathematical Models for Decision Making. He specialized in Artificial Intelligence at ETH Zurich.He has hands-on experience in end-to-end data-driven projects development in various industries, with a focus on manufacturing and retail. He supports the design of Data Strategies, ranging from business cases identification to algorithms and data products development. “Remember to forget: fight neural network memorization”In this talk, Andrea will show you a New Theory that cracks open the Black Box of Deep Learning with Information theory: A new idea called the “information bottleneck” is helping to explain the puzzling success of today’s artificial-intelligence algorithms. Hewill put down his own research to help you deal with deep learning memorization. Recent works changes the way we must think about generalization. With the help of Yoshua Bengio's ideas and Information theory we will try to open the Black Box of Deep Learning and how to deal with it. Andrea MarisioAndrea is a Deep Learning Engineer at Boom Image Studio. In his previous experience he did a master at Università degli Studi dell’Insubria and worked in NTT DATA. Andrea is passionate about learning and teaching... to machines. Guided by his passion he is helping businesses to grow in the new AI era. Where?

      " Communication goes hand-in-hand with leadership. In fact, when you are a good speaker, people see you as a leader! Isn't such a skill essential for your career? These are the skills we learn and practice at our Toastmaster meetings. Toastmasters is the optimum place to practice. Experimentation is encouraged. Failure tells us there's room for improvement. In that sense, you've succeeded in identifying skills that need work. Keep practicing and you'll see positive results over time. At Center Berlin Toastmasters, you'll find a safe, supportive environment, just right for experimenting as you develop your new speaking and leadership skills. WHAT IS TOASTMASTERS? Check it on our group description. OUR MEETINGS ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: - Prepared SpeechesToastmaster members prepare 5-7 minute speeches on a topic of their choice. In each speech they work on specific speech objectives - structure, word choice, vocal variety, body language. As a guest, you listen to and enjoy the speeches. - Impromptu SpeechesGuests and members are asked to speak about a topic on the spot. These speeches are 1-2 minutes long. They are as much fun as they are challenging. - EvaluationsA Toastmaster is designated at the beginning of the meeting to evaluate one of the prepared speeches. He/she emphasizes the strengths of the speech and offers suggestions for improvement. This feedback is always given in a friendly and positive manner. Discussions about Club business in the end take about 10 minutes. If it sounds boring for you, you can definitely skip this part ;) After the meeting there's socializing and small talk. Visit meetings as often as you like.We love guests - you are our best audience. There's no guest fee and no pressure to join. Just fun! We meet every 1st, 2nd and 3rd Tuesday of the month in the Gemeindesaal at St. Lukas-Kirche (remember: we are non-religious organisation) Doors open at 7:00 PM. Meeting starts promptly at 7:30 PM.

We've heard major announcements from upstarts such as Figma and Framer; we've seen big initiatives from established players such as InVision, Bohemian, and Adobe; and we've even had big tech enter the scene, like Apple with their SwiftUI toolset. All this alongside the tens of startups announcing new design tool products every other week for the past two years. It is an exciting time to be a designer! In this talk, we'll take a look at how design tools are changing, what improvements are coming, what improvements we wish were coming, and with our wish list, we'll paint a picture of what our ideal design tool would look like. Speaker: Aria Minaei Aria is part designer and part developer. He believes designers can code; coders can design; and users can create; He thinks the right design tool will unlock this potential, and he is working on one such tool himself. https://twitter.com/ariaminaei/ ---- Tak two: The Age of Reinvention Talk Abstract: We’re in an age of limitless possibilities. By way of both the nature of technology and the job market it spurs, to stay competitive and up to date, we have to adopt a mindset of continuous learning and identity fluidity; we must learn the art of reinventing ourselves. Gone are the days of working in the same job for 50 years. To become prevalent, this reinvention must be more than just a superficial name change on one's resume or Linkedin account, it needs to be something one dedicates both time and effort to. The question is: how do you decide what to focus on learning yourself and when to bring in other specialists to collaborate? How do you avoid information overload and burnout? Come join the talk as we explore these questions and more together. Speaker: Tabitha Swanson Tabitha Swanson is a multi-disciplinary designer and researcher. In classic millennial style, her career path has gone something like this: graphic design —> fashion —> marketing —> art direction —> UX/UI —> 3D —> currently exploring machine learning and its possibilities in the design world. ---- 🎤Open Mic Session Here is where you put your big, brave pants on and jump on stage. This is a safe and open space for you to speak to your fellow designers. Perhaps you’re looking for feedback, partnership or advice on a project you’re working on or simply have a question.

      " The second geomob is focussed on Machine Learning and AI and how it is transforming the geospatial industry. The goal of #geomobMUC will be the same as #geomob London and Barcelona: to provide a forum to learn and exchange ideas about interesting services and projects that deal with location. Everyone working in or curious about the location space or with location services is welcome, you do not need to be some sort of GIS expert (though GIS experts are of course welcome as well). What I am most interested in is not pure geo technology, but rather the application of new geo technologies in services and product of all kind. The goal is not pitch presentations or marketing, but rather interesting talks by doers about their experiences. The talks are a chance to learn, but equally important is the dialogue between the attendees. Come by and join us! ####################################################################AGENDA: Great talks, interesting discussions and drinks!#################################################################### We will follow the time-tested #geomob format followed in London and Barcelona with a slight change Doors open at 18.15. All talks will be in English. (A) “Wind throw detection using deep learning on Planet and high-resolution aerial images”- Wolfgang Deigele, Master student, TU Munich (B) “Location Based Business Opportunity Detector”- David Nogué, CEO and Co-founder, EIXOS Economic Observatory (C) How drones, AI and geospatial analytics are transforming the Energy sector?- Aleksander Buczkowski, Senior Manager, Drone Powered Solutions, PwC and Founder of Geoawesomeness (D) Design by DataBilge Kobas, Co-founder, Bits’ n Bricks Interested in speaking at the event? Send us an email at [masked] Afterward, we will host a discussion and networking session and we are looking forward to getting everyone connected with each other! ####################################################################Spread the word and stay updated#################################################################### Please tell everyone you know who may find the evening interesting.

      " Simple and effective communication in your career or on a football pitchgoes hand-in-hand with success. Communication is The Make Or Break Factor of Success! Success is not built on individual talents, victory is built on the Team cohesion. It starts with speaking.In fact, when you are a good speaker, people see you as a leader.Lead, motivate, and develop your team members. These are the skills we learn and practice at our Toastmaster meetings in a friendly environment. We grow as a team. Toastmasters is the optimum place to practice. Experimentation is encouraged. Failure tells us there's room for improvement. In that sense, you've succeeded in identifying skills that need work. Keep practicing and you'll see positive results over time. At Center Berlin Toastmasters, you'll find a safe, supportive environment, just right for experimenting as you develop your new skills. Center Berlin Toastmasters meets every 1st, 2nd and 3rd Tuesday of the month. Contact us at [masked]. Toastmasters is a non-religious, non-political, non-profit organization. Everyone is welcomed and treated with the same respect. We meet regularly to build our speaking and communication skills; to come together with great people; to fail gloriously and emerge wiser. At Center Berlin Toastmasters (http://centerberlin-toastmasters.de/) you'll find others who also believe in learning by doing. Our shared goal is to improve our ability to speak in public without letting fear take over. Growth as a speaker comes through plenty of stage time and more than a little courage. Developing a confident voice takes a willing attitude, continued practice, and the support of a group that wants you to succeed. That's us. That's Toastmasters. WHAT IS TOASTMASTERS? Since 1924, Toastmasters has been a leader in helping individuals improve their confidence and grow their communication skills. Our approach is very simple: - Toastmasters give constructive, supportive feedback to each other. - You improve through regular practice. - On-line educational program guides you in meeting fundamental speech and leadership objectives. Center Berlin Toastmasters is an English language public speaking and leadership club and part of the worldwide Toastmasters Organization (http://toastmasters.org/). Both native and non-native English speakers have the opportunity to improve their speaking, listening, and people skills through self-paced practice and supportive feedback. OUR MEETINGS ARE DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS: - Prepared SpeechesToastmaster members prepare 5-7 minute speeches on a topic of their choice. In each speech they work on specific speech objectives - structure, word choice, vocal variety, body language. We build natural, convincing, authentic speeches step-by-step. - Impromptu SpeechesGuests and members are asked to speak about a topic on the spot. These speeches are 1-2 minutes long. They are as much fun as they are challenging. - EvaluationsA Toastmaster is designated at the beginning of the meeting to evaluate one of the prepared speeches. He/she emphasizes the strengths of the speech and offers suggestions for improvement. This feedback is always given in a friendly and positive manner. After the meeting there's socializing and small talk. Visit meetings as often as you like.We love guests - you are our best audience. There's no guest fee and no pressure to join. We meet every 1st, 2nd and 3rd Tuesday of the month in the Gemeindesaal at St. Lukas-Kirche. Doors open at 7:00 PM. Meeting starts promptly at 7:30 PM. Come early to mingle. You'll quickly see how much fun and how effective this is.\n",

      " Machine Learning, User Generated Content oder der Kampf gegen Fake-Reviews: In drei Talks gibt das Online Buchungs- und Bewertungsportal HolidayCheck Einblick in das Thema User-Bewertungen.Experten aus unterschiedlichen Fachbereichen erklären, wie HolidayCheck gegen Fake-Bewertungen vorgeht, nachhaltige Kundenbindungen aufbaut und mittels Künstlicher Intelligenz und Deep Learning die Kunden schneller zu dem für sie passenden Urlaub führt. Ablauf18:30 Uhr Einlass und Ankommen (es gibt Getränke und eine Kleinigkeit zu essen)19:00 Uhr Talks20:30 Uhr Austausch und Fragen zu den Themen Hinweis: Die Räume bei HolidayCheck sind klimatisiert, es gibt auch eine Dachterrasse, für gekühlte Getränke ist gesorgt ;-) Über die TalksTalk 01: Machine Learning auf Basis von Hotelbewertungen und -bildern Speaker Dr. Thomas Mayer Abstract:Begriffe wie “Machine Learning” oder “Künstliche Intelligenz” (KI) sind momentan in aller Munde. Kein Wunder, gibt es derzeit regelmäßig bahnbrechende Fortschritte im Bereich des “Deep Learnings” bei der Auswertung von Text- und Bilddaten zu vermelden. Bei HolidayCheck bewerten Kunden ihre Urlaube, in dem sie Kommentare, Bewertungen und Bilder zu besuchten Hotels hinterlassen. Dr. Thomas Mayer, Teamlead Deep Learning bei HolidayCheck, zeigt auf, wie die Bewertungen mit Hilfe von neuronalen Netzen ausgewertet werden; mit dem Ziel, Urlauber zu unterstützen, schneller den für sie passenden Urlaub zu finden. Talk 02: Hooked - Wie wir mit verhaltensorientierten Methoden eine Bindung aufbauen Speaker: Georg Köhler Abstract:Eine Community wie HolidayCheck lebt von dem freiwilligen Engagement vieler Personen. Durch die Abgabe von Bewertungen, sogenanntem User Generated Content (UGC), trägt jeder Einzelne dazu bei, dass Bewertungen und Bilder von Hotels für andere Nutzer auffindbar sind. Zudem fördern Sie einen hilfreichen Austausch im Forum und geben den Usern die Möglichkeit, sich untereinander zu helfen. Anhand einiger exemplarischer HolidayCheck-Seiten demonstriert Georg Köhler, Senior UX Designer, wie man mit verhaltensorientierten Methoden einen großen Beitrag für die Entwicklung der Community erzielt und die Kunden und deren Engagement nachhaltig an das Unternehmen bindet. Talk 03: Der Kampf gegen gefälschte Bewertungen – HolidayCheck geht konsequent gegen Bewertungsbetrug vor Speaker: Georg Ziegler Abstract:All-Inclusive in Ägypten oder lieber Agriturismo in Italien? Bei der Entscheidungsfindung zum perfekten Urlaub ziehen viele Menschen Bewertungen anderer Urlauber zu Rate. Gefälschte Bewertungen - ob positiv oder negativ – führen Verbraucher dabei vorsätzlich in die Irre und bewegen sie zu falschen Entscheidungen. Georg Ziegler, Director Brand, Content und Community erklärt, mit welchen Mitteln HolidayCheck gegen organisierten Bewertungsbetrug vorgeht und wie das Unternehmen sich dafür einsetzt, das Thema Fake-Bewertungen in der Öffentlichkeit transparent zu machen und aus der rechtlichen Grauzone zu heben.\n",

      " Ce mois-ci nous sommes chez Doctolib, une licorne française!Merci à eux de nous accueillir dans leurs locaux :)  Voici le programme de la soirée: => Accueillir des junior·e·s en reconversion : comment éviter l'échec par Cindy Liwenge (@cindyliwenge (https://twitter.com/cindyliwenge)) Avec la multiplication des formations accélérées, on observe depuis quelques années une augmentation du nombre de développeu·euse·s en reconversion. Ces profils présentent une diversité importante et des compétences professionnelles riches. Toutefois, malgré l'apparente bienveillance de notre milieu, accueillir des junior·e·s en reconversion n'est pas aisé. Les premières expériences de ces développeur·euse·s sont déterminantes et, parfois, découragent certain·e·s, jusqu'à l'abandon. Comment réussir l'intégration des junior·e·s en reconversion ? Comment prendre en compte et valoriser leurs différences ? Et surtout : comment les retenir ? Lors de ce talk, je partagerai mes expériences et les histoires (vraies) de succès et d'échecs. Grâce à ces REX et en nourrissant mon discours de références, je donnerai des pistes pour permettre aux équipes en place de préparer le terrain et de passer des paroles aux actes. => Nous avons mis 50 devs sur un monolithe, vous ne devinerez jamais la suite ! par Jérémy Buisson (@jbuiss0n (https://twitter.com/jbuiss0n)) et Bertrand Paquet (@_bpaquet (https://twitter.com/_bpaquet)) A Unicorn's Workflow, ou comment nous faisons collaborer 50+ dev sur un unique monolith dans Github, à l'aide de nos process et de nos outils, et comment nous construisons jour après jour Doctolib. => Pour mieux travailler quittez votre job et voyagez ! par Saad Ansari (@LeFreelance (https://twitter.com/LeFreelance)) Puisque c'est la période, parlons de vacances !Tout plaquer pour voyager ? Je l'ai fait ! Il y a quelques années je décidais d'arrêter mon métier de développeur pour partir à l'aventure au bout du monde. Depuis, je suis revenu et ai repris mon activité professionnelle. Aujourd'hui je me rends compte que le fait d'avoir arrêté de travailler pendant tout ce temps m'aide, encore aujourd'hui, à mieux vivre ma vie professionnelle. Dans ce talk je vous explique comment :-) => DevSec : Comment créer des développeurs experts en sécurité ? par Michael Mollard Entre 2005 et 2014, le nombre de data breaches a augmenté de 500%. Alors que des mouvements tels que DevOps ont permis d'améliorer la collaboration entre les développeurs et les ops, les équipes de développement et de sécurité sont aujourd'hui classiquement très silotées et n'ont pas les mêmes enjeux. L'objectif de DevSec vise une même collaboration entre ces deux mondes et je vous présenterai en quoi outiller les équipes techniques les sensibilise aux sujets de sécurité et leur permet de détecter des vulnérabilités plus tôt dans le cycle de développement. Au programme : librairies, outils, software factory. --- Proposez vos sujets pour les prochaines sessions : https://humantalksparis.herokuapp.com/submit-talk\n",

      " Eindruck auf Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p-ZTPy4bpw&t=30s von meinem Instagram Account @hamedsinsta Die interessantesten Menschen aus Hamburg und Umgebung kommen jeden Mittwoch um 19 Uhr zusammen, um bei einer ungezwungenen Runde um die Alster zu spazieren und dabei viele neue Menschen kennen zu lernen. Ganz gleich, ob Du selbst Hamburger bist oder gerade erst hierher gezogen bist: das Walk & Talk bietet dir ein einzigartiges Format, um Dich an der frischen Natur zu bewegen ( sage und schreibe 7,3 Kilometer ) und dabei alle 10 Minuten einen neuen Gesprächspartner an deiner Seite zu haben. Oft kommen 20, teilweise sogar 80 ( Rekord 2017 ) Menschen zusammen, um sich für 2 Stunden was Gutes zu tun. Verbinde die Natur, Bewegung und das Netzwerken miteinander. Dieses Event ist perfekt für jeden, der neue Kontakte knüpfen, sich mehr bewegen und keine Lust auf klassische Networking Events hat :) Achja, und das Ganze ist komplett kostenlos. Am Anfang hatte ich ( Hamed Farhadian ) das Event initiert, doch inzwischen ist es über Hamburg's Grenzen hinaus gewachsen. Ob in Stuttgart oder München, wir wollen, dass noch mehr Menschen miteinander ins Gespräch kommen. Das Thema entscheidest Du. Raus aus dem Käfig: Lerne weltoffene Menschen kennen, die du unter normalen Umständen niemals kennenlernen würdest. Durch den ungezwungenen Austausch entstehen neuartige Gespräche, die du bisher nicht kennst. Übrigens: Schon Sokrates wusste, dass es sich bei Gehen besser denken lässt :) Wie ist der Ablauf:Um Punkt 19 Uhr beginnt der Walk & Talk vor dem Haupteingang des AlsterCliffs ( Fährdamm 13, 20148 Hamburg ). In einer kurzen Vorstellrunde stellt sich jeder kurz vor und der letzte aus der Vorstellrunde muss den Timer setzen, so dass es alle 10 Minuten klingelt. Und danach geht es auch schon los ( traditionell stadteinwärts, aber das darf die Community selbst entscheiden ). Alle 10 Minuten wird einmal WECHSEL geschrieben und alle suchen sich wahllos den nächsten Gesprächspartner und gehen weiter. Bei normaler Spaziergeschwindigkeit dauert die Runde ungefähr 2 Stunden, so dass man mindestens 10 neue Menschen in dieser Zeit gesprochen hat. Wenns menschlich passt, kann und sollte man sich natürlich vernetzen oder klassisch Telefonnummer austauschen. Wer noch nicht dabei war, sollte sich dieses Eventformat UNBEDINGT einmal anschauen. Wer smart ist, sollte das fest in den Kalender eintragen und jeden Mittwoch um 19 Uhr mitmachen. Ich kann aus eigener Erfahrung sagen, dass man danach deutlich besser schläft, sich über die Jahre ein MEGA Netzwerk aufbaut und einfach fitter ist. Das Ganze ist völlig kostenlos, es ist keine Werbeveranstaltung und es gibt keinen Haken. Leider kann ich selbst nicht immer dabei sein, da ich immer öfter nicht in Hamburg bin. Wenn ich aber Zeit finde, komme ich selbst natürlich auch vorbei. Ich wünsche euch allen viel Spaß bei der Runde, viele unterhaltsame Gespräche und jede Menge neuer Impulse und Beziehungen. Bei Fragen könnt ihr mich direkt über die Meetup anschreiben oder per Email unter [masked]\n",

      " ♦ Security by design Lors de cette présentation je vais vous expliquer les fondamentaux de la sécurité, et nous allons voir ensemble comment identifier les risques présents dans le code d’une application dès sa conception. Ce talk s’adresse aux développeurs, leaders et chefs de projets et concerne toutes entreprises et associations. Ceci est d'autant plus vrai depuis la RGPD : les sanctions sont devenues plus chères que la mise en place de moyens de préventions. Lors de ce talk nous ne parlerons pas de la partie infrastructure mais nous allons nous focaliser sur le code et les outils d'analyse. Nous verrons en particulier la configuration des outils d’analyse et leurs mises en place dans une chaîne d'intégration en s’appuyant sur un retour d’expérience. Par Thibault Barske @Tibs245 ———— ♦ Comment empêcher Jean-Kévin du 62 de hacker votre application Durant cette conférence, nous parlerons de divers trucs et astuces pour protéger ses applications rapidement, simplement et surtout à moindre frais. Les attaques MITM (man in the middle), les injections sql, les bruteforces sur les formulaires de login, l'utilisation de webShell et tant d'autres attaques. Certaines de ces attaques ne vous disent peut-être rien, cependant elles sont toutes aussi dangereuses car elles permettent à un hacker de prendre la main totalement ou partiellement sur votre serveur et ainsi devenir l'administrateur de ce dernier. Plusieurs possibilités s'offrent à nous :- HTTPS- Utiliser un ORM pour les requêtes dans la base de données- Dockeriser l'application- HTTP/2- Mettre en place un firewall- Automatiser les bannissements avec Fail2Ban- Mercure Ce sont des solutions tirées arbitrairement qui vous permettront de sécuriser votre application rapidement et facilement.

Terraza AtenasCalle Segovia s/nParque Atenas28005 Madrid La Terraza Atenas, situada en el céntrico parque del mismo nombre, a los pies de la Catedral del la Almudena, es una de las terrazas por excelencia de la noche madrileña. Por el 'ovni de Atenas', una terraza puramente industrial de acero, hierro y cristal, han desfilado la flor y nata del pijerío moderno madrileño, en busca del frescor del césped, las vistas nocturnas y ese ambiente entre canalla y high class de la zona de los Austrias. El nuevo mobiliario, el frescor de la hierba, las increíbles vistas de la catedral, la calidad del servicio, la seguridad y, en general, el buen ambiente que se respira nada más llegar, convierten a Atenas en una de las terrazas más clásicas y, a la vez, más de moda en Madrid. QUEDAMOS A LAS 22.30 Coste del evento 5 euros, por organización y convocatoria por meetup. Y así podéis pedir lo que queráis, muy recomendables los mojitos. y DESPUÉS de estar de terraceo iremos al Contraclub de bailoteo. CUALQUIER CONSULTA JORGE[masked]\n",

Come check out the CoMakingSpace :-) During this weekly meetup, volunteers offer guidance and supervision for members as well as tours for those who are interested in our community workshop! Besides Raspberry Pi and other electronics projects, you could try your hand at woodworking, metalworking, 3D printing, CNC routing or (soon) laser cutting, for example.Tool introductions are not always possible on short notice, especially when it's a busy evening - best arrange yourself with a tutor in advance! The meetup usually lasts longer than the 1.5 hours we \"promise\" here, check out the calendar on our website for the current plans! https://comakingspace.org/kalender.html ~~~Was immer du bauen möchtest, versuchen wir gemeinsam zu ermöglichen! Komm vorbei und schau dir den CoMakingSpace an :-) Während dieses wöchentlichen Meetups bieten freiwillige Tutoren Hilfestellung und Aufsicht für Mitglieder an sowie Führungen für Neulinge, die an unserer offenen Werkstatt interessiert sind!

      " Ubiqum is thrilled to announce a special event taking place on Tuesday 16 July across our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam. We will interview three members of the IBM Watson Discovery News team, a cutting edge project applying Watson’s AI engine and advanced data science techniques to reimagine how news is conveyed. Jenny Woo (shown above) and John Carpenter (check out his Instagram it’s seriously cool: instagram.com/johnbcarpenter/) are the lead visualization experts on the team and Tom Wall is the Sr. Software Engineer, so you will have the opportunity to learn both about the front- and back-end aspects of how Watson Discovery News was built. Following the event please stick around to discuss what we learned and network with Ubiqum’s students, alumni and friends in each city._______________________________________ AGENDA 17:30 - open doors: meet & greet with food & drinks17:45 - introduction18:00 - live AMA with IBM Watson19:30 - debate & controversy, networking & fraternising20:30 - goodbye _______________________________________ ABOUT IBM WATSON IBM Watson is one of the world’s most powerful Artificial Intelligence machines. It famously utilized breakthrough research in Natural Language Processing to defeat the greatest Jeopardy champions. To learn more about the Discovery News project with Watson, we strongly encourage you to check out Jenny Woo’s recent article on Medium: Visualizing the News with Watson Discovery (https://medium.com/design-ibm/visualizing-the-news-with-watson-discovery-13e8be538428)._______________________________________ WHAT IS AN “AMA”? The “Ask-Me-Anything” format is an opportunity for you, the participants, to pose your own questions to experts. We will solicit questions from the community in advance and then use them to drive the discussion. Nathan Benjamin, Ubiqum’s Head of Product, will facilitate the discussion with Guillem Perdigo, Sr. Data Mentor in Berlin. The IBM Watson team will join the discussion from their offices in New York. The event will be broadcast live in our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam for live attendees, and streamed on Ubiqum’s Facebook and LinkedIn pages. Capacity is limited at some of our locations, so we cannot guarantee you a spot but will let you know ahead of time if the event is full, and of course, we encourage anyone unable to attend to join us via the live stream. We look forward to seeing you on July 16th!\n",

      " To further build our community around Cologne we are establishing the Think About! Stammtisch. Join us for great and healthy food with drinks, interesting talks and wonderful attendees. Join us for the talk \"Succeeding as an Introvert\" by Elizabeth Zagroba. _______________________________________________ SCHEDULE:18:30 – Opening Doors & Food19:00 – Talk20:00 – Q&A21:00 – Drinks & fun_______________________________________________ ABOUT THE TALK: You’re an introvert. You do your best work when you can think a problem through alone in a quiet space. You express yourself better in writing or when you have a heads up before a meeting. But your company is cool! So your office resembles a sweatshop: large rows of desks squished into a concrete room with minimal sound deadening. And you company culture encourages team work! So anyone can call you or stop by your desk with immediate requests of varying levels of emergency. You’re always being put on the spot, only later to think of who would be best qualified to answer the question, what a better solution might be, or where an inefficiency could be eliminated. In my talk, I'll frame my learnings from Quiet by Susan Cain and Introvert Power by Laurie Helgoe with personal experiences about how to function effectively in offices unfriendly to introverts. I'll explore how American culture rewards those who speak the most over those who have something to say. _______________________________________________ ABOUT THE SPEAKER: Elizabeth tests software at Mendix in Rotterdam, The Netherlands. She was the keynote speaker at Let’s Test in South Africa in 2018, and she’s spoken at Agile Testing Days’ and other conferences in North America and Europe. Her article about mind maps became one of the most viewed on Ministry of Testing Dojo in 2017. You can find Elizabeth on the internet on Twitter and Medium.

It creates a safe and inspirational space for everyone, and we really mean everyone. Our belief is that society needs diversity in order to continue a healthy and critical dialogue. For this reason, we want to bring together diverse individuals and enable them to challenge themselves and each other.

      " 17:30 Welcome and Pizza18:00 Fast Track Intro to DeepLearning18:30 What's new in TensorFlow 2.019:15 Build Enterprise AI Pipelines using KubeFlow Talk Summary:Toward the end of 2015, Google released TensorFlow, which started out as just another numerical library, but has grown to become a de facto standard in AI technologies. TensorFlow received a lot of hype as part of its initial release, in no small part because it was released by Google. Despite the hype, there have been complaints on usability. Especially, for example, the fact that debugging was only possible after construction of the static execution graph. In addition to that, neural networks needed to be expressed as a set of linear algebra operations which was considered too low level by many practitioners. PyTorch and Keras addressed many of the flaws in TensorFlow and gained a lot of ground. TensorFlow 2.0 successfully addressed those complaints and promises to become the go-to framework for many AI problems. Romeo Kienzler introduces you to the most prominent changes in TensorFlow 2.0 and how you can use these new features successfully in your projects. He explores eager execution, parallelization strategies, the advantages of the tight high-level Keras integration, live neural network training monitoring using TensorBoard, automated hyper parameter optimization, model serving with TensorFlow service, TensorFlow.js, and TensorFlow Lite. He shares an outlook on TFX—where Google is planning to open source its complete AI pipeline—and contrasts it with existing de facto standard frameworks like Apache Spark. Speaker Bio:Romeo Kienzler is Chief Data Scientist at the IBM Center for Open Source Data and AI Technologies (CODAIT) in San Fransisco, owning the strategy lead for AI Model Training. He works as Associate Professor for artificial intelligence at the Swiss University of Applied Sciences Berne and his current research focus is on cloud-scale machine learning and deep learning using open source technologies including TensorFlow, Keras, DeepLearning4J, Apache SystemML and the Apache Spark stack. He also contributes to various open source projects. He regularly speaks at international conferences including significant publications in the area of data mining, machine learning and Blockchain technologies.

      " Continuamos dando difusión al evento Agile Open Camp. En esta ocasión nos juntaremos en la Fnac de Callao en Madrid el próximo 9 de julio para conversar sobre por qué fallan las iniciativas de cambio en grandes organizaciones. En un formato colaborativo, la sesión estará enfocada a impulsar un proceso de inteligencia colectiva en el que todos los asistentes puedan reflexionar sobre las razones del fracaso de las iniciativas de cambio y contribuir en la identificación de acciones y medidas que ayuden a lograr su éxito. En un contexto de cambio continuo como el que nos encontramos en el que cualquier organización necesita ser muy versátil con este Meetup pretendemos que todas las personas que asistan tengan su espacio para compartir sus experiencias en procesos de cambio y a partir de ellas cocrear propuestas e iniciativas que puedan serles de ayuda para anticipar el fracaso o superar las resistencias a los cambios. Agenda-----------------------------------------------* Check-in de los asistentes* Presentación del Agile Open Camp España 2019* World Café ¿Por qué falla el cambio?* Puesta en común de los resultados* World Café ¿Qué acciones podemos tomar?* Puesta en común de los resultados* Check-out de los asistentes ¿Dónde y cuándo?-----------------------------------------------Fnac Callao MadridMartes 9 de julio de 19h a 21h ¿Qué es el Agile Open Camp?-----------------------------------------------El Agile Open Camp (AOC) es un evento comunitario colaborativo, auto-organizado y sin fines de lucro.

Get your free ticket now! ***https://www.eventbrite.es/e/validate-your-idea-build-a-prototype-in-2-hours-tickets-64604399498 “Prototypes are the new PowerPoints” Like a picture is worth more than a thousand words: a prototype is worth a successful startup! For who: Business people, marketing, creatives or anyone with an idea for a digital business or an app Why: The cost of launching a failed idea or product is one of the main reasons for failure in the world of entrepreneurship. But the digital environment offers us tools at zero cost, to increase the chances of success. Start-ups in all the world, small or big, apply lean methodologies to develop products, where one of the main principles is to test and validate an idea before its development and launch.And the best way to do this is through an interactive prototype. What will you learn? - How to define a clear value proposition and translate it into an interactive prototype- Basic UX/UI concepts (user tasks and navigation flow)- Wireframes and mockups: what is the difference?- Design techniques and tools (colors, typography, images)- How to work with Figma ( a free software)- How to create a UI Kit ( a library of visual elements)- High fidelity prototypes and added interaction- How to run user tests About the instructor: Gus De Vita is the founder of Le Wagon Spain. With a long career in companies such as eDreams and Softonic, he decided to leave the corporate world, learn to code and share this knowledge with all those who aspire to bring their ideas to life, land a career in tech and speak the language of the future.

      " In anticipation of new class leading hardware availability from AMD, Nvidia, ARM, and Phison, Raspberry Pi, we'll discuss the hardware and software options that enable machine learning models to become bigger, faster, and cheaper. We'll also discuss lesser known software optimizations such as quantization, bfloat16, MLIR project, and direct access to GPUs in the browser. Tuesdays are applied machine learning day. We have a peer-to-peer discussion with a focus on an applied machine learning topic. We also meet on Fridays when we discuss a predetermined research paper. Discussion: 1. How close are we to the long promised ML desktop systems which use novel ML acceleration hardware? When will we be able to stop talking about these nonsensical GPU solutions and get ML purpose built accelerators? 2. Will the industry move towards hardware based models (e.g. BERT wired FPGAs)? 3. How powerful would an x64 system have to be to compete with $1,000 GPUs for float32, float16, bfloat16 and integer quantization? Will a system with a 64 core 4.6Ghz CPU and 4600Mhz memory (no GPU) compete with a system with 4 core 5Ghz CPU with a $500 GPU? 4. What is the Moore's law equivalent for GPUs? What compute power can we expect in 2022, 2024, ...? 5. What ML benchmarking software is available? 6. What compute power will be needed to reach the singularity?

      " *** REGISTRATION THROUGH EVENTBRITE: https://www.eventbrite.com/e/setting-design-processes-w-delivery-hero-the-family-tickets-64425918657?aff=Meetup *** Design can be very subjective. Everybody has a different opinion on what looks good and which colors go better in which context.But at the end of the day, there are processes that help set a design identity into place, that is coherent with the brand values and coincides with the target audience. 🙌 We have two amazing people joining us to share their expertise around product & brand design: 🔥 Karolina Skalska, Director Of Product Design at Delivery Hero🔥 Alice Zagury, CEO & Co-Founder of The Family // LINE UP ➡️ HOW TO SET END-TO-END PRODUCT DESIGN PROCESSES w/ Karolina Skalska, Director Of Product Design at Delivery Hero Have you ever asked yourself these questions:- What is the perfect product design process?- How your team should do it?- When to cut corners and when to stay strong behind it? There isn't a silver bullet but Karolina can definitely answer some of the questions. Stay tuned while she reveals the secrets of a well-crafted product design process that will help you and your team to meet user needs and business objectives in a reasonable time. She will cover the end-to-end process, starting from when designers should get themselves involved until measuring the final outcome and [hopefully] success of the designs. 🚀 Karolina is a multifunctional creative human being for whom doing impossible takes just slightly longer. Currently, as a Director of Product Design at Delivery Hero she focuses on bridging the gap between business, technology, and the user. Karolina strives for data-driven design, beautiful interfaces and including engineering and product in design decision. ➡️ SETTING THE FIRST STEPS FOR A UNIQUE BRAND Alice Zagury, CEO & Co-Founder of The Family Alice Zagury was born into a family driven by the progressive ideals of the 1960s, a world full of music, art and culture.Growing up in the suburbs, she felt and saw the discrimination and underlying racism around her. The 2008 crisis exacerbated things, reinforcing just how incapable their society was at integrating young people and minorities. 🙌 She discovered the tech world almost by accident. She first worked with art galleries and artists’ collectives, and then some engineers, before she was struck with the desire to help those new players of economic growth, startups. The digital world used fresh tools that could defeat those barriers that she had always seen: a culture of sharing, of learning from one’s errors, that valorises “doing”. As much as she is an incredible business woman, Alice is an artist. She puts high value into transforming brands into perfectly executed art pieces. That’s why The Family stands out. 🤩 --- The event is 100% open and free! 😉 It will be followed by a Q&A to satisfy your curiosity as well as some time to get to know each other over cookies and drinks 🍪🍷 Don't forget to register to let us know you're coming 😉:https://www.eventbrite.com/e/setting-design-processes-w-delivery-hero-the-family-tickets-64425918657?aff=Meetup ------------------------------------- The Family nurtures ambitious startups in Europe.

      " Quando l'Agilità sale sul palcoscenico e gli attori siamo noi. Durante questo meetup vivremo una serie di \"scene\" su come variare le dinamiche di eventi quali lo \"Stand-up\", la \"Retrospettiva\" o attività di team building. Ispirandomi alle dinamiche teatrali sperimenteremo:- l'importanza del ruolo del facilitatore- cosa vuol dire \"creare ed uscire dalle zone di comfort\"- l'importanza di riconoscere le proprie fragilità- come l'energia e l'efficacia di un'attività di gruppo nascono da ognuno di noi. Gli esercizi che svolgeremo sono tratti dal libro \"Improving-Agile Teams\" di Paul Goddard, Agile Coach con cui ho avuto il piacere di confrontarmi e imparare molto a Londra. Avremo inoltre due ospiti speciali, Vito Semeraro e Alberto Pastorelli, di Forma.lms che ci racconteranno la loro esperienza riguardo l’introduzione di principi e pratiche “Agili” nella propria organizzazione, in particolare ascolteremo le loro sfide più impegnative riguardo l’adozione di nuovi strumenti, tecnologie e metodologie!

      " ☀ This will be the summer edition of the Berlin MusicTech Meetup. ☀ It will take place at the beautiful schönwetter* beach bar, right at Mauerpark. Since this meetup edition is outside and the sun won't set before 10 pm, it will have no fixed ending 😃. Let's all make the most out of it. The overall topic for this meetup is \"Music Creation In (And For) New Contexts\". 1st presenter will be Attila Haraszti (@haywirez/@rawfare).He will present http://songsling.io, a service that lets artists turn their music into interactive tracks that react to changes on the Internet. The talk will dive into the history and legacy of music playback systems and point out the dangers of leaving music presentation in the hands of a few dominant platforms. It will highlight the unrealized potential of our devices and detail his quest to build a web player that lets the listener explore - and DJ - tracks straight from an artist’s website. 2nd presenter will be Julia Vrady with AI-Ambient-Visualisation at the sets. Her project is about the visualisation of the ambient at music sets. Every artist is unique. Not only his music. Also the audience, that comes for the set, emotions of the audience, objects, energy…. Every live concert is a synthesis of arts. Combination of the features creates the unique ambient, that can never be the same, even by the same artist. For her new project, Julia has been trying to make visible the ambient of the space and the mood of the audience. The artist will decide and will see in real time, how the mood of the audience can change. It allows the artist to be more experimental. And for the audience, it is the deep immersion into the music and the moment. http://wrady.com/ The 3rd presenters will be Rory Kenny from Music Maker JAM. He will talk about The dawn of a new era: enter the AI Composer.As AI in music starts to mature, a new kind of creator emerges. One who interacts lightly or deeply with the AI studio to produce instant & infinite music compositional variations. Rather than focus on the threat, let’s take a moment to focus on the possibilities which lie ahead.JAM created Alfie, an AI music creation platform, to enable anyone to play, discover & create amazing music. After hitting a key milestone in April 2019, JAM is confident that they can now double-down on their mission to bring it to a mass market of creators. In his presentation, Rory will reveal their approach and demo 4 music tracks created by Alfie. https://www.justaddmusic.net/ We will also have four extremely cool installations. All of them are exclusive, not-yet-released prototypes of super innovative approaches for new ways to create, and interact with, music. Spencer Rudnick will bring along his modular synth based on the Web Audio API, called Synth Kitchen. https://synth.kitchen/ Sascha Naji will gives you the chance to play with the “preliminary\" Prototype of Beatlash, an expressive performance controller to play electronic music. http://beatlash.com/ Jakob Gruhl will set up his latest Mazetools project which allows you to control Mazetools Soniface by using gestures with LeapMotion or Kinect. http://www.mazetools.com & https://ectoplastic.com/ Henrik Langerdas has just successfully finished the Kickstarter campaign for the new Eurorack Interface 2.4SINK of Instrument of Things which lets you wirelessly control of modular-Synths and analog musical instruments. http://www.instrumentsofthings.com We will have the \"Wall Of Opportunities\" again. It might not really be an entire wall this time but I promise there will be enough space for everyone to get the word out. Thanks to the amazing people at BRLO, we will also have a limited number of super tasty free beer. ;) Come early to get a taste of it. Please help spreading the word and join us with your music-tech friends. 🎶♥ Cheers,Matt Facebook Event: https://www.facebook.com/events/2287433904681875/\n",

      " Join us at Criteo HQ Paris to gain insight on the current challenges faced by the AI-based tech industry. We will be hosting worldwide top-notch speakers working to build the online applications of tomorrow. ⌚ Agenda :6:30 pm : welcome7:00 pm : talks9:00 pm : networking_______________________________________________________________________________________ 🎤 Ricardo Baeza-Yates, CTO at Ntent📃 Semantic Search and Query Intent PredictionSemantic search lies in the cross roads of information retrieval and natural language processing and is the current frontier of search technology. A main component is predicting the intention behind the query, which implies doing semantic query understanding. This process implies the same semantic processing as a document. After, based on all this information, we have to predict one or more possible intentions with a certain probability, which is particularly important for ambiguous queries. These scores will be one of the inputs for the final semantic ranking, a key second component. Semantic ranking refers to ranking search results using semantic information. In a standard search engine, a rank is computed by using signals or features coming from the search query, from the documents in the collection being searched and from the search context, such as the language and device being used. In our case we add semantic relations between the entities and concepts found in the query was the same objects in the documents, that will come from different data sources. For this we use machine learning in several stages. The first stage selects the data sources that we should use to answer the query. In the second stage, each data source generates a set of answers using ``learning to rank.'' The third and final stage ranks these data sources, selecting and ordering the intentions as well as the answers inside each intention (e.g., news) that will appear in the final composite answer. All these stages are language independent, but may use language dependent features. 🎤 Mounia Lalmas, Director of Research at Spotify📃 Personalizing the listening experienceWhen users interact with a recommendation system, they leave behind fine grained traces of interaction signals, which contain valuable information that could help gauging user satisfaction.Quantifying such a notion of satisfaction from implicit signals involves1) understanding the diverse needs of users,2) their expectations of what is a successful streaming session,3) the recommender system goal to provide a personalized experience that also allows for discovery. This talk will describe methods explored to provide a more informed definition of satisfaction. 🎤 Patrick Gallinari, Distinguished Researcher at Criteo📃 Learning visual context representationsCharacterization of objects in images most often relies on the intrinsic properties of the objects, i.e. their visual appearance. The context in which these objects do appear is an important source of information but is usually ignored. We present two investigations demonstrating the importance of visual context. One concerns learning multimodal words representation using both textual information and the visual context of corresponding objects. The second one addresses the problem of zero shot learning for object recognition in images. 🎤 Diego Saez Trumper, Research Scientist at Wikimedia📃 Wikimedia Public (Research) ResourcesThe Wikimedia Foundation's mission is to disseminate open knowledge effectively and globally. In keeping with this mission, the Wikimedia Foundation support research in areas that benefit the Wikimedia community. We aim to make any work with our support openly available to the public. At the same time that we do a minimalist user data collection, all the material (text and multimedia) available in our projects is public and reusable by everybody.\n",

      " Bonjour à toutes et tous, Nous planifions un Meetup AWS le 9 juillet prochain dans les locaux d'AWS. Nous parlerons sécurité dans le cloud. 🎙Talk 1 : Back From Re:inforce - Stephan Hadinger AWS organise cette année à Boston les 22 et 23 juin son premier évènement mondial dédié à la sécurité :Re:Inforce. Ce premier talk présentera les nouveautés présentées lors de cet évènement. 🎙Talk 2 : La gestion des habilitations AWS - Jeremie RodonLes Boundary Policies Depuis des années, dans le monde AWS, un problème existait au sein d'IAM... Un problème simple, catastrophique d'un point de vue sécurité et difficile à mitiger sans amputer grandement l'expérience utilisateur. Lorsqu'on construit une solution AWS, qu'elle soit serverless, en conteneur ou sur EC2, il est courant qu'elle est besoin d’intéragir avec l'API AWS: on doit donc lui fournir un ou des rôles IAM taillés pour elle. De fait, au sein d'une entreprise, ceux qui construisent ses applications ont besoin de pouvoir créer des rôles IAM. Seulement voilà : si un utilisateur a le droit de créer un rôle, qu'est-ce qui l'empêche de créer un rôle ayant tous les droits, qu'il pourra ensuite assumer, escaladant alors ses privilèges ? Comment peut-on donner à ses utilisateurs le droit de créer des rôles, sans en faire, de fait, les administrateurs de notre compte AWS ? Il y a un an, la réponse était simple : rien ; depuis, la réponse a changé : les Boundary Policies. Venez découvrir leur principe de fonctionnement ! 🍕🍕🍕🍻🍻🍻\n",

      " Gemeinsam mit unseren Kooperationspartnern KURSWECHSEL (www.kurswechsel.jetzt) und HEC Gmbh (www.hec.de), möchten wir euch gerne zu einem spannenden Diskussionsabend mit BORIS GLOGER höchstpersönlich einladen!Ein großes Dankeschön an dieser Stelle an den Sponsor KURSWECHSEL, der sich um die Räumlichkeiten und die Verpflegung kümmert. ACHTUNG! Das Meetup findet in BREMEN statt! -------------- Boris Gloger - Vordenker, Autor, Scrum-Pionier: \"Seien wir ehrlich: Kinder lernen im Schulunterricht etwas, das sie in weiten Teilen nicht interessiert und das ihnen – bis auf wenige Ausnahmen – im Leben nicht weiterhilft. Die Folge sind lustlose Schüler, die sich durch den Unterricht quälen und nicht ausreichend auf das Leben und die Arbeitswelt vorbereitet werden. Ein Dilemma ist das auch für unsere Wirtschaft, denn die ist künftig mehr denn je auf fähige und resiliente Menschenangewiesen. Schule bildet für das Leben aus? Ich denke nicht: Sie ist vielmehr eine„Aufbewahrungsanstalt“, gemacht für den Kultusminister, die Lehrer und Schulbehörden und die Eltern, damit diese zur Arbeit gehen können. Die, die nicht gefragt werden sind die Schüler. Ihr Potential wird nicht entfaltet, sondern erstickt. Es wird deshalb Zeit für einen Paradigmenwechsel, der aus meiner Sicht nur zwei Möglichkeiten zulässt: 1. Wir brauchen eine radikale Umkehr der Unterrichtsmethoden. Statt der Inhalte muss der Schüler im Mittelpunktstehen. Self-Directed Learningals Weg - auch in der Schule. 2. Das sogenannte Freilernen als weitere Alternative. Ich finde es sollte in Deutschland Usus werden — doch bis es es soweit ist: Nutzen wir Scrum und machen die Schüler zu den Product Ownern und Usern ihres eigenen Lernstoffes. Erste Initiativen in Deutschland und Österreich zeigen, dass sich dadurch die Motivation und der Lernerfolg um ein Vielfaches steigern lässt.\" -------------- Boris ist ein deutscher Scrum-Pionier und Vordenker für neue Arbeitsformen. Mit seiner Unternehmensberatung borisgloger consulting unterstützt er nicht nur DAX- und ATX-Unternehmen in agilem Organisationsmanagement, sondern treibt auch im eigenen Unternehmen neue Arbeitsweisen im Tagesgeschäft an. Im Jahr 2002 führte er erfolgreich sein erstes Scrum-Team bei der österreichischen ONE (später Orange Austria Telecommunication). Seitdem ist er maßgeblich an der Etablierung von Scrum als Standard für agile Softwareentwicklung in Europa, Südafrika und Brasilien beteiligt. Er ist Autor mehrerer Fachbücher zu den Themen Agilität und Scrum und hat bis heute mehr als 5000 Manager und Teams in Scrum ausgebildet. Boris ist zutiefst von Selbstorganisation und dem Freiwilligkeitsprinzip überzeugt, um bestmöglich Ziele zu erreichen und wirklich ein selbstbestimmtes Leben zu führen. Als erster zertifizierter Scrum-Trainer in Deutschland, arbeitet er seit nunmehr fast zwei Jahrzehnten leidenschaftlich mit dem Framework und hat sich kürzlich der Aufgabe gestellt, die Bildungsangebote mit Scrum4Schools zu verbessern. Boris Gloger vertritt die Ansicht, dass Deutschland nach wie vor eine führende Nation im Bildungswesen ist, aber plädiert für mehr Mut, die gut ausgebildeten Menschen auch einzusetzen. Nur so kann Deutschland (und die EU) mit globalen Innovatoren wie China, Asien und den USA mithalten und langfristig nicht abgehängt werden. Denn: Bildung ist der Schlüssel zu einer Nation, die eine führende Rolle bei Innovation und Fortschritt einnehmen möchte. -------------- Zeitplan:17:30 Einlass 18:00 Begrüßung 18:05 Interaktive Vortrags-Session \"Scrum4Schools - oder Kinder brauchen keine Schule\" mit Boris Gloger 19:00 Feedback & Diskussionen ab 19:30 Networking Wir freuen uns sehr über eure Teilnahme.\n",

      " Are you ready for a day filled with brilliant speakers, thought-provoking ideas and mind-blowing conversations?!Then join us on July 30th for our 4th TEDxHeidelberg! One hype chases the other, buzzwords are floating around in today’s meeting culture and it seems nearly impossible to distinguish between a trend actually having an impact on society and one, which is entirely being built on hot air. The world is changing faster than ever before and companies, society and politics alike are confronted with a continuously increasing complex world. Which problems to tackle first? Which opportunities should be prioritised? Trapped in a deadlock of selective perception many people already struggle to identify the most important aspects of their own lives.This year we’ll dive into the question „Who cares?!“ and try to find answers on why we consider some things to be more irrelevant than others.Some speakers will provocatively play around with the question, others will passionately show you what they care about - and we’ll try our best to find out, what you care about the most! Tickets - Reduced: € 39Tickets - Standard: € 69Event Language: English/ German - we’ll offer simultaneous translation :) Content: The event covers talks on various fields from technology and science to personal experiences and entertainment, up to global and social issues. For more information: www.tedxheidelberg.de +++++++++++ Bist Du bereit für einen Tag voll brillanter Redner, zum Nachdenken anregender Ideen und atemberaubender Gespräche?!Dann bist Du bei TEDxHeidelberg am 30. Juli genau richtig! Ein Hype jagt den anderen, Schlagworte schweben in der Arbeitswelt von heute herum. Es scheint fast unmöglich, zwischen einem Trend zu unterscheiden, der tatsächlich Auswirkungen auf die Gesellschaft hat, und einem, hinter dem nicht mehr als heiße Luft steckt. Die Welt verändert sich schneller als je zuvor und Unternehmen, Gesellschaft und Politik sind mit einer ständig wachsenden und immer komplexeren Welt konfrontiert. Welche Probleme sollten zuerst gelöst werden? Welche Möglichkeiten als erstes genutzt? Gefangen in einer Sackgasse der selektiven Wahrnehmung kämpfen viele Menschen bereits damit, die wichtigsten Aspekte ihres eigenen Lebens zu identifizieren.In diesem Jahr werden wir auf die Frage „Wen interessiert's?!\" eingehen und versuchen, Antworten zu finden, warum wir einige Dinge für irrelevanter halten als andere.Einige Redner werden provokativ mit der Frage herumspielen, andere werden Dir leidenschaftlich zeigen, was sie interessiert - und wir werden unser Bestes tun, um herauszufinden, was Dir am wichtigsten ist! Tickets - Reduziert: € 39Tickets - Standard: € 69Eventsprache: Englisch/ Deutsch - wir bieten eine Simultanübersetzung an :)Inhalt: Die Veranstaltung bietet Vorträge aus verschiedensten Themengebieten - von Technologie und Wissenschaft über persönliche Erfahrungen und Entertainment bis hin zu sozialen und globalen Fragestellungen.

      " TypeScript ist vielen Webentwicklern ein Begriff und etabliert sich zur neuen Standard-Programmiersprache im Web. Aber was kann man damit genau machen und lohnt es sich, umzusteigen? Die Verwendung von TypeScript ist keine Entscheidung gegen JavaScript. Sie folgt eher dem aktuellen Trend, JavaScript mithilfe von Transpilern zu generieren, um mit moderneren Sprachfeatures arbeiten zu können. TypeScript selbst ist ein Superset von JavaScript und bietet primär Funktionalität an, die entweder in einer zukünftigen Version von ECMAScript Standard wird oder aber syntaktischen Zucker für bestehende Funktionalitäten bietet. Fabian Grebe von der traperto GmbH tauch mit euch in die Welt von TypeScript ab und gibt anhand von verschiedenen Beispielen einen Einblick, wie TypeScript funktioniert und welche Vorteile es bietet.\n",

      " BioEmma Haruka Iwao is a Japanese computer scientist and cloud developer advocate at Google. In 2019 Iwao calculated the world's most accurate value of pi (π); which included 31.4 trillion digits, far past the previous record of 22 trillion. BackgroundAs a child, Iwao became interested in pi. She was inspired by Japanese mathematicians, including Yasumasa Kanada. She studied computer science at the University of Tsukuba, She was awarded the Dean's Award for Excellence in 2008, before starting graduate studies in computing. Her master's dissertation considered high performance computer systems.After graduating, Iwao took on several software engineering positions, working on site reliability for Panasonic, GREE and Red Hat. CareerAfter joining Google in 2015, Iwao became a Cloud Developer Advocate in 2017. She originally worked for Google in Tokyo, before moving to Seattle in 2019. Iwao focuses on the use of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), as well as supporting application developers. She works to make cloud computing accessible for everyone, creating online demos and teaching materials. Calculating Pi: Talk abstractWe have calculated 31.4 trillion digits of Pi in 2019 and broke the world record in the Pi computation. The process took about four months and 200 TiB of storage. Record-breaking Pi calculations have traditionally been done on supercomputers and special-made hardware, but we did it on Cloud for the first time. This talk will discuss the nature of the calculation, the architecture, challenges and techniques, and of course the brief history of Pi computation. Calculating Pi has been the speaker's childhood dream and this talk will also explain how the small dream grew to the new world record.\n",

      " Ubiqum is thrilled to announce a special event taking place on Tuesday 16 July across our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam. We will interview three members of the IBM Watson Discovery News team, a cutting edge project applying Watson’s AI engine and advanced data science techniques to reimagine how news is conveyed. Jenny Woo (shown above) and John Carpenter (check out his Instagram it’s seriously cool: instagram.com/johnbcarpenter/) are the lead visualization experts on the team and Tom Wall is the Sr. Software Engineer, so you will have the opportunity to learn both about the front- and back-end aspects of how Watson Discovery News was built. Following the event please stick around to discuss what we learned and network with Ubiqum’s students, alumni and friends in each city._______________________________________ AGENDA 17:45 - open doors: meet & greet with drinks18:00 - live AMA with IBM Watson19:30 - debate & controversy, networking & fraternising20:30 - goodbye _______________________________________ ABOUT IBM WATSON IBM Watson is one of the world’s most powerful Artificial Intelligence machines. It famously utilized breakthrough research in Natural Language Processing to defeat the greatest Jeopardy champions. To learn more about the Discovery News project with Watson, we strongly encourage you to check out Jenny Woo’s recent article on Medium: Visualizing the News with Watson Discovery (https://medium.com/design-ibm/visualizing-the-news-with-watson-discovery-13e8be538428)._______________________________________ WHAT IS AN “AMA”? The “Ask-Me-Anything” format is an opportunity for you, the participants, to pose your own questions to experts. We will solicit questions from the community in advance and then use them to drive the discussion. Nathan Benjamin, Ubiqum’s Head of Product, will facilitate the discussion with Guillem Perdigo, Sr. Data Mentor in Berlin. The IBM Watson team will join the discussion from their offices in New York. The event will be broadcast live in our offices in Barcelona, Madrid, Berlin and Amsterdam for live attendees, and streamed on Ubiqum’s Facebook and LinkedIn pages. Capacity is limited at some of our locations, so we cannot guarantee you a spot but will let you know ahead of time if the event is full, and of course, we encourage anyone unable to attend to join us via the live stream.

There’s no universal answers, but Johanna will happily share a little insight of her personal experiences. Johanna Springer is a freelance Illustrator, working and living in Hamburg. Her main focus is illustration for print, editorial illustration and character design. She mainly works digitally, but strives to create an analog look and feeling. — David Ost, product manager at PhraseAppphraseapp.com For digital products offered in global markets, translation has become an inherent part of the user experience. But are Design and content teams on the same page? UX copy shouldn’t be left for last, and neither should translating it into multiple languages. David will share how he and his team built an integration for Sketch that takes the pain out of UX localization and what challenges they came across. David has been a product manager with PhraseApp since the beginning of 2018, where he is responsible for platform integrations. PhraseApp is a translation management platform that enables developers, product managers, designers, copywriters, and translators to come together to create the best local user experience for global digital products. — Julia Bondarenko, Senior UX Designer at collectAI, Writer at UX Collective Prototyping automated customer communication flows for a B2B Fintech software with a design sprint.

      " Hands up if you want your code to always work as expected! Together with good design principles, automated tests are a powerful tool that helps you to write code that’s maintainable and extendable.When done the right way, automated tests help you to- ensure your code works - in a more reliable and fast manner than if you were trying it out by hand- ensure it still works after you refactor it- come up with a more decoupled architecture for your code- document your code so that someone (likely you) who sees code later is faster able to tell what your code does It takes a bit of training and experience to write tests that achieve these goals. Also, tests don’t take the task of properly thinking a bit ahead as to what you want to achieve away from you. And you'll still need to learn and be able how to design your code well. But that doesn’t mean that you should postpone learning about and writing tests until you know everything - because you’ll never know everything! It’s best to start learning how to write good tests now, and expect your ability to write good tests to grow with your experience and ability to write well designed clean code. In this meetup we’ll look at different kinds of tests for our Python applications and available libraries that are there to help us write and run these tests efficiently.To better understand testing from a practical perspective, we’ll we'll start writing unit tests in the hands-on part. *Thought Works hosts PyLadies Hamburg* Bring your laptop and come prepared to learn something new and write Python code together! Beginners: In this session there are numerous Hands-on exercises to help you. Advanced: There are exercises for you as well. Or, do you have your own project? ... Then simply bring it along! • Gesa and Sarah are Software Developers at ThoughtWorks and they for sure like it when their code works as expected. • Snacks and drinks:- Yes • Gender policyPyLadies aims to provide a friendly support network for women and a bridge to the larger Python world. Anyone with an interest in Python is encouraged to participate! We apply the LadyNerds Code of Conduct (http://bit.ly/LadyNerds-CoC ). • ContactInterested in speaking at one of our events?

Conoces alguna plataforma gratuita y de código abierto que te permita la escritura de aplicaciones de código administrado sobre pequeñas electrónicas integradas? Aprende como construir diferentes tipos de proyectos orientados a pequeñas placas electrónicas programando en C#, tales como sensores IoT, dispositivos portátiles, pruebas de concepto, robótica, creaciones para entusiastas / fabricantes o incluso equipos industriales complejos. Estas plataformas hacen que sea más fácil, más rápido y menos costoso crear aplicaciones para circuitos integrados embebidos utilizando las mismas tecnologías y herramientas modernas utilizadas por los desarrolladores de aplicaciones de escritorio. En este workshop trabajaremos con varias tarjetas electrónicas con el microprocesador ARM STM32F4 de bajo coste de (ST Microelectronics y GHI Electronics.

      " This is all about building things in the browser: HTML, CSS and lots of JavaScript. We are a friendly group that meets every Wednesday to learn together and work on our projects. Bring your laptop (otherwise we can provide one for you) and your challenges and questions. There's always someone around that is happy to help you or would love to get some help. No matter if you are an absolute beginner or an experienced expert, we want to learn from each other. Doors open latest at 19:30h, introduction round at 20:00h. Usually there is no talks or lessons planned but we can come up with something together if there's interest. If you don't have a project to work on or don't know where to start it's also a good idea to do some online classes or tutorials. We're here to help with that, too. For example check out some of our OpenTechSchool workshop material: JavaScript for Beginners 1 (http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-1/) | JavaScript for Beginners 2 (http://opentechschool.github.io/js-beginners-2/) | Intro to HTML/CSS (http://cssclass.es/materials/) We speak German and English, sometimes even Italian, and of course code. Just come by and check it out! Oh, and bring some snacks, maybe ;) You're also welcome to join our chat on Gitter (https://gitter.im/OpenTechSchool/BLN-WFColearning).

Wrangling is an important part of any data analysis and Pandas Python library is designed to make data analysis fast and easy. If you want to become more Pandas-savy join us to boost your panda skills so you can spend more time gaining insights in your next project and less time manipulating your data! We will also have a raffle for the goodies in the photograph 🎉 sent to us from another pyfriend @amcasari from PyLadies Seattle • Level:- beginner • Pre-requisites:- your laptop and sudo/admin rights- git- having gone through the pandas lessons on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/learn/pandas • Gender policyWe believe knowledge is for all and at the same time our events aim primarily to empower women tech community. We request non-female attendees to be aware of this situation and make their presence discrete. Eg. by coming with a female plus one to ensure gender balance, avoiding to be heard more than the rest of the attendees in discussions and question sections. • Photography / video consentWe take photos and videos during the event to use for documentation and in social media such as here in Photo albums, Facebook, Twitter, etc. By coming to the meetup, you willingly give consent to take photos and videos of you. If you do not want to give your consent, please let us know at check-in. • SponsorsThank you to Kiwi.com & mytaxi.com for sponsoring part of the travel for the Hamburg PyLadies to join us in Berlin. Thank you to our Hosts ThoughtWorks who will also be sponsoring drinks. ======= https://source-lift.com Most open source teams would love to organize sprints to move their projects forward. They may also dream of attending a specific conference together, or organizing a sprint. However, the budget is always a problem and these dreams rarely become a reality. Kiwi.com has decided to do something about this, so we created the SourceLift Fund to bring communities together. By providing travel vouchers, we hope to boost the progress of FOSS projects while rewarding tireless contributors with a well-deserved trip at the same time. ======== https://mytaxi.com mytaxi was founded in June 2009 and was the world’s first taxi app that established a direct connection between a passenger and a taxi driver. Within 2019, mytaxi will rebrand to FREE NOW. We have three tech hubs: Barcelona, Hamburg, and Berlin. Our daily business is solving large-scale, highly complex technical problems – and we love it. ======== • ContactInterested in speaking at one of our events? Have a good idea for a Meetup?

      " Wir leben in einer sogenannten VUCA-Welt. Disruptive Geschäftsmodelle sorgen dafür, dass etablierte Branchen und Unternehmen von heute auf morgen von der Bildfläche verschwinden, dass anspruchsvolle Innovationsprojekte über Nacht obsolet werden, richtige Entscheidungen von heute können schon morgen vollkommen falsch sein. Organisationen und ihre Führungskräfte und MitarbeiterInnen müssen lernen, Fehler und Scheitern als eine Option anzuerkennen und mit diesen Erfahrungen konstruktiv umzugehen. In dem Workshop am 18. Juli 2019 im Henley Campus an der Maximilianstraße 40 in München gibt Bert Overlack Einblicke in das „erfolgreiche“ Scheitern: Warum scheitern Menschen im Beruf und wie können sie, aber auch ihre KollegInnen und die Organisation, aus diesen Erfahrungen lernen? Ausgehend von der Insolvenz seines Unternehmens reflektiert Bert Overlack seine persönliche Scheiter-Erfahrung anhand aktueller wissenschaftlicher Forschungsergebnisse und leitet hieraus Erkenntnisse und Einsichten für den persönlichen, unternehmerischen und gesellschaftlichen Umgang mit Scheitern ab. In Kleingruppen setzen sich die TeilnehmerInnen mit den Fragen auseinander, warum Projekte scheitern, welche Voraussetzungen für ein optimales Lernen aus Scheiter-Erfahrungen erforderlich sind und was Führungskräfte tun können, um ihre MitarbeiterInnen in diesem Umfeld bestmöglich zu unterstützen. Wir beginnen wie immer mit Networking um 18.30 Uhr und der Workshop startet um 19 Uhr; das Ende ist für 21 Uhr geplant, gefolgt von einer halben Stunde Networking zum Ausklang.\n",

      " Moving to a new city and culture is a great chance and also a great challenge.When starting over new in a new environment we take our old selves and patterns with us. It is a great moment to step back and uncover patterns that no longer serve us in order to allow us to thrive fully in our new lives. But you don´t have to start over new to start over new: anywhere and anytime is the right moment to look at what is unconsciously holding you back. Rebecca Szeto, an Executive Consultant as well as Relationship Coach from Hong Kong and eminent authority in the field of systemic coaching, will give us an insight into her work leading up to her workshop on „Relationship and you“ on Saturday July 13th. About the Expert speaker: Rebecca Szeto has worked systemically as an IT manager for global companies such as Bank of America, Digital Equipment and others.

      " Details18:30 Socialising, snacks & drinks19:00 Welcome --------------- Life without passwords [30min]by Panos Angelopoulos (Pure Labs) No one likes to remember, store and use passwords every single time that they want to login into an account. In my company, for our latest project, we completely removed password authentication and used a one-time password not as an alternative option but as our only one! A lot of services out there provide the one time password or one-time links as an alternative authentication method. As a team, we took a decision to contribute to an open source project and improve it. Our goal was to use the nopassword authentication system as the only auth method in the project. The project is an iOS/Android/Web application which currently is live. Bringing Data Science into a Cross-Functional-Team [30min]by Christoph NützelData Science recently has become a new part of many digital projects and products around the globe. Besides bringing a 'cool' touch to a project, it also added some challenges to the daily work.These challenges brought various learnings with them, that were introduced to the existing ways of working. But the transformation didn’t stop just there. In his talk, Christoph Nützel, Senior Software Engineer at Futurice, will shine a light on how to bring data science deep into the work culture and how it works to really become a data-driven company. He will share his learnings and show you concrete actions for specific problems he faced in his day-to-day work with clients and that data science does not always need a data scientist to be successful.\n",

      " Still happening! :)Hi Happy People! Join us at our new location at a new time!How nice our meetings this year at the Tennis Club....so great to be outdoors in this beautiful green spot. English conversation, games, and new friends await you!This Wednesday, June 26, we will meet at the Appio Claudio Tennis Clubin the heart of the beautiful Parco degli Acquedotti. As usual just 10euros for an hour and a half of conversation and fun, as well as adrink of your choice and delicious snacks. Practice you English in arelaxing and fun way. We start at 6:30 P.M. See you then! English Happy Hour is a one and a half hour meet-up in English where you will have the opportunity to make new friends, enjoy an aperitivo, and practice your English with the help and guidance of two native speaker English teachers. As long time teachers In Italy we have noticed that though almost everyone has studied English at school, there are few opportunities for practicing it in “real situations” . This is the reason that we started the English Happy Hour last year. English Happy Hour is different from the many tandem language events that are around because for the entire time you will be speaking in English, not “exchanging” with Italian or any other language. It is like a little ” full immersion” We welcome all nationalities and all ages (ages 14+) Metro A Subaugusta Easy parking Location:http://www.appioclaudiotennisclub.it/ Pay cash at the door- €10* *Discount for native English speakers Appio Claudio Tennis ClubViale Appio Claudio 115For more info :[masked]How to get there: Metro A to Subaugusta stop. Go on Via Tito Labienountil the entrance to the park on Via Lemonia. Cross (and enjoy) thepark and exit on Viale Appio Claudio. The Tennis Club is on the right.By car: Via Appia Nuova until Viale Appio Claudio. Folllow Appio Claudiopassing under two bridges until the end of the road at the entrance tothe park. The Tennis Club is on your left. Cos'e'? Un incontro di conversazione in lingua inglese con annesso aperitivo, giochi, e nuove amicizie, guidato da due insegnanti madrelingua . Come funziona? Per un’ora e mezza si parla solo ed esclusivamente in inglese, conoscendo nuove persone (o chiacchierando con quelle gia’ conosciute) e parlando uno ad uno, e divertendosi anche con delle attività di gruppo, sempre con l’aiuto delle madrelingua. Le insegnanti hanno molti anni di esperienza lavorativa in Italia e hanno riscontrato il fatto che moltissime persone hanno studiato l’inglese ma raramente hanno l’opportunità di praticarlo ed usarlo in una situazione “reale”, ed e' nata questa iniziativa. English Happy Hour è diverso dagli eventi “tandem” che spesso si trovano in giro, perche’ si parla solo in inglese tutto il tempo e non si fa “scambio” con l’italiano o altre lingue. È un piccolo full immersion. N.B. Costa €10, si paga direttamente all’evento, in contanti . Per tutte le nazionalità e tutte le età (dai 14 anni in su) We look forward to meeting all of you! :)Jessica and Margery\n",

      "https://www.meetology.onto/260916198 ---> https://schema.org/description ---> We know that everyone loves a talk about a new automation or security tool, or a live demo of some cool new framework... But tonight we're talking about the most important tool a tester can wield - their brain! We've got a couple of great talks about the skills a that a human tester can bring to the table and why we'll still be safe when the robots take over. The rough running order for the evening will be: 6:30 - Doors open7:00 - First Talk7:30 - Break and food7:45 - Second Talk8:15 - Leg stretch8:30 - Head off to a local pub for networking and such. --- Talk one: Iain Mc - Why all new parents are basically testers. For the past 18 months, almost all Iain has done is be a parent or a tester, and it turns out some of the skills required are transferable! He'll be taking a (hopefully) entertaining look at where the two jobs overlap. --- Talk two: Cat Luker - Why Can't We All Just get Along? Robots are takin' our jawbs! Manual testing is old news! It's all about automating in the CI / CD cloud with the IoT blockchain! Neither of these is really the situation on the ground with software testing today, so what's the best approach? Cat will talk about differences in approach, where manual testing is better than automated and vice versa, and even tackles the vexed question of unit tests. Come to this talk to discover a third way, or at least hear me rant about Jenkins :D --- Big thanks to our sponsors - U Account for keeping us fed and watered, and Tech Parks for letting us use their wonderful meeting space!
